<h2>ADVERTISEMENT TO THE FIRST EDITION</h2>
<p>The success which attended the publication in this Series of Illustrated
Works of <i>A Woman&rsquo;s Journey round the World</i>, has induced the 
publication of the present volume on a country so little known as Iceland, 
and about which so little recent information exists.</p>
<p>The translation has been carefully made, expressly for this Series, from
the original work published at Vienna; and the Editor has added a great 
many notes, wherever they seemed necessary to elucidate the text.</p>
<p>In addition to the matter which appeared in the original work, the 
present volume contains a translation of a valuable Essay on Icelandic 
poetry, by M. Bergmann; a translation of an Icelandic poem, the 
&lsquo;V&ouml;lusp&acirc;;&rsquo; a brief sketch of Icelandic History; and 
a translation of Schiller&rsquo;s ballad, &lsquo;The Diver,&rsquo; which is
prominently alluded to by Madame Pfeiffer in her description of the 
Geysers. <a name="citation1"></a><a href="#footnote1" 
class="citation">[1]</a></p>
<p>The Illustrations have been printed in tints, so as to make the work 
uniform with the <i>Journey round the World</i>.</p>
<p>London, August 1, 1852.</p>
<h2>AUTHOR&rsquo;S PREFACE</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Another journey&mdash;a journey, moreover, in regions which every
one would rather avoid than seek.&nbsp; This woman only undertakes these 
journeys to attract attention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first journey, for a woman <span class="smcap">alone</span>, 
was certainly rather a bold proceeding.&nbsp; Yet in that instance she 
might still have been excused.&nbsp; Religious motives may perhaps have 
actuated her; and when this is the case, people often go through incredible
things.&nbsp; At present, however, we can see no just reason which could 
excuse an undertaking of this description.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus, and perhaps more harshly still, will the majority judge me.&nbsp; 
And yet they will do me a grievous wrong.&nbsp; I am surely simple and 
harmless enough, and should have fancied any thing in the world rather than
that it would ever be my fate to draw upon myself in any degree the notice 
of the public.&nbsp; I will merely indicate, as briefly as may be, my 
character and circumstances, and then I have no doubt my conduct will lose 
its appearance of eccentricity, and seem perfectly natural.</p>
<p>When I was but a little child, I had already a strong desire to see the 
world.&nbsp; Whenever I met a travelling-carriage, I would stop 
involuntarily, and gaze after it until it had disappeared; I used even to 
envy the postilion, for I thought he also must have accomplished the whole 
long journey.</p>
<p>As I grew to the age of from ten to twelve years, nothing gave me so 
much pleasure as the perusal of voyages and travels.&nbsp; I ceased, 
indeed, to envy the postilions, but envied the more every navigator and 
naturalist.</p>
<p>Frequently my eyes would fill with tears when, having ascended a 
mountain, I saw others towering before me, and could not gain the 
summit.</p>
<p>I made several journeys with my parents, and, after my marriage, with my
husband; and only settled down when it became necessary that my two boys 
should visit particular schools.&nbsp; My husband&rsquo;s affairs demanded 
his entire attention, partly in Lemberg, partly in Vienna.&nbsp; He 
therefore confided the education and culture of the two boys entirely to my
care; for he knew my firmness and perseverance in all I undertook, and 
doubted not that I would be both father and mother to his children.</p>
<p>When my sons&rsquo; education had been completed, and I was living in 
peaceful retirement, the dreams and aspirations of my youth gradually awoke
once more.&nbsp; I thought of strange manners and customs, of distant 
regions, where a new sky would be above me, and new ground beneath my 
feet.&nbsp; I pictured to myself the supreme happiness of treading the land
once hallowed by the presence of our Saviour, and at length made up my mind
to travel thither.</p>
<p>As dangers and difficulties rose before my mind, I endeavoured to wean 
myself from the idea I had formed&mdash;but in vain.&nbsp; For privation I 
cared but little; my health was good and my frame hardy: I did not fear 
death.&nbsp; And moreover, as I was born in the last century, I could 
travel <span class="smcap">alone</span>.&nbsp; Thus every objection was 
overcome; every thing had been duly weighed and considered.&nbsp; I 
commenced my journey to Palestine with a feeling of perfect rapture; and 
behold, I returned in safety.&nbsp; I now feel persuaded that I am neither 
tempting Providence, nor justly incurring the imputation of wishing to be 
talked about, in following the bent of my inclinations, and looking still 
further about me in the world I chose Iceland for my destination, because I
hoped there to find Nature in a garb such as she wears nowhere else.&nbsp; 
I feel so completely happy, so brought into communion with my Maker, when I
contemplate sublime natural phenomena, that in my eyes no degree of toil or
difficulty is too great a price at which to purchase such perfect 
enjoyment.</p>
<p>And should death overtake me sooner or later during my wanderings, I 
shall await his approach in all resignation, and be deeply grateful to the 
Almighty for the hours of holy beauty in which I have lived and gazed upon 
His wonders.</p>
<p>And now, dear reader, I would beg thee not to be angry with me for 
speaking so much of myself; it is only because this love of travelling does
not, according to established notions, seem proper for one of my sex, that 
I have allowed my feelings to speak in my defence.</p>
<p>Judge me, therefore, not too harshly; but rather grant me the enjoyment 
of a pleasure which hurts no one, while it makes me happy.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">THE AUTHOR.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<p>In the year 1845 I undertook another journey; <a name="citation2"></a><a
href="#footnote2" class="citation">[2]</a> a journey, moreover, to the far 
North.&nbsp; Iceland was one of those regions towards which, from the 
earliest period of my consciousness, I had felt myself impelled.&nbsp; In 
this country, stamped as it is by Nature with features so peculiar, as 
probably to have no counterpart on the face of the globe, I hoped to see 
things which should fill me with new and inexpressible astonishment.&nbsp; 
How deeply grateful do I feel to Thee, O Thou that hast vouchsafed to me to
behold the fulfilment of these my cherished dreams!</p>
<p>The parting from all my dear ones had this time far less bitterness; I 
had found by experience, that a woman of an energetic mind can find her way
through the world as well as a man, and that good people are to be met with
every where.&nbsp; To this was added the reflection, that the hardships of 
my present voyage would be of short duration, and that five or six months 
might see me restored to my family.</p>
<p>I left Vienna at five o&rsquo;clock on the morning of the tenth of 
April.&nbsp; As the Danube had lately caused some devastations, on which 
occasion the railroad had not entirely escaped, we rode for the first four 
miles, as far as Florisdorf, in an omnibus&mdash;not the most agreeable 
mode of travelling.&nbsp; Our omnibuses are so small and narrow, that one 
would suppose they were built for the exclusive accommodation of 
consumptive subjects, and not for healthy, and in some cases portly 
individuals, whose bulk is further increased by a goodly assemblage of 
cloaks, furs, and overcoats.</p>
<p>At the barriers a new difficulty arose.&nbsp; We delivered up our 
pass-warrants (<i>passirscheine</i>) in turn, with the exception of one 
young man, who was quite astounded at the demand.&nbsp; He had provided 
nothing but his passport and testimonials, being totally unaware that a 
pass-warrant is more indispensable than all the rest.&nbsp; In vain did he 
hasten into the bureau to expostulate with the officials,&mdash;we were 
forced to continue our journey without him.</p>
<p>We were informed that he was a student, who, at the conclusion of term, 
was about to make holiday for a few weeks at his parents&rsquo; house near 
Prague.&nbsp; Alas, poor youth! he had studied so much, and yet knew so 
little.&nbsp; He had not even an idea of the overwhelming importance of the
document in question.&nbsp; For this trifling omission he forfeited the 
fare to Prague, which had been paid in advance.</p>
<p>But to proceed with my journey.</p>
<p>At Florisdorf a joyful surprise awaited me.&nbsp; I met my brother and 
my son, who had, it appears, preceded me.&nbsp; We entered the train to 
proceed in company to Stockerau, a place between twelve and thirteen miles 
off; but were obliged to alight halfway, and walk a short distance.&nbsp; 
The Embankment had given way.&nbsp; Luckily the weather was favourable, 
inasmuch as we had only a violent storm of wind.&nbsp; Had it rained, we 
should have been wetted to the skin, besides being compelled to wade 
ankle-deep in mud.&nbsp; We were next obliged to remain in the open air, 
awaiting the arrival of the train from Stockerau, which unloaded its 
freight, and received us in exchange.</p>
<p>At Stockerau I once more took leave of my companions, and was soon 
securely packed in the post-carriage for transmission.</p>
<p>In travelling this short distance, I had thus entered four carriages; a 
thing sufficiently disagreeable to an unencumbered person, but infinitely 
more so to one who has luggage to watch over.&nbsp; The only advantage I 
could discover in all this was, that we had saved half an hour in coming 
these seventeen miles.&nbsp; For this, instead of 9 fl. 26 kr. from Vienna 
to Prague, we paid 10 fl. 10 kr. from Stockerau to Prague, without 
reckoning expense of omnibus and railway.&nbsp; It was certainly a 
dearly-bought half-hour. <a name="citation3"></a><a href="#footnote3" 
class="citation">[3]</a></p>
<p>The little town of Znaim, with its neighbouring convent, is situated on 
a large plain, extending from Vienna to Budwitz, seventeen miles beyond 
Znaim; the monotony of the view is only broken here and there by low 
hills.</p>
<p>Near Schelletau the scenery begins to improve.&nbsp; On the left the 
view is bounded by a range of high hills, with a ruined castle, suggestive 
of tragical tales of centuries gone by.&nbsp; Fir and pine forests skirt 
the road, and lie scattered in picturesque groups over hill and dale.</p>
<p>April 11th.</p>
<p>Yesterday the weather had already begun to be ungracious to us.&nbsp; At
Znaim we found the valleys still partly covered with snow, and the fog was 
at times so thick, that we could not see a hundred paces in advance; but 
to-day it was incomparably worse.&nbsp; The mist resolved itself into a 
mild rain, which, however, lost so much of its mildness as we passed from 
station to station, that every thing around us was soon under water.&nbsp; 
But not only did we ride through water, we were obliged to sit in it 
also.&nbsp; The roof of our carriage threatened to become a perfect sieve, 
and the rain poured steadily in.&nbsp; Had there been room for such a 
proceeding, we should all have unfurled our umbrellas.</p>
<p>On occasions like these, I always silently admire the patience of my 
worthy countrymen, who take every thing so good-humouredly.&nbsp; Were I a 
man, I should pursue a different plan, and should certainly not fail to 
complain of such carelessness.&nbsp; But as a woman, I must hold my peace; 
people would only rail at my sex, and call it ill-humoured.&nbsp; Besides, 
I thanked my guardian-angel for these discomforts, looking upon them as a 
preparation for what was to befall me in the far North.</p>
<p>Passing several small towns and villages, we at length entered the 
Bohemian territory, close behind Iglau.&nbsp; The first town which we saw 
was Czaslau, with its large open square, and a few neat houses; the latter 
provided with so-called arbours (or <i>verandahs</i>), which enable one to 
pass round the square dry-footed, even in the most rainy weather.</p>
<p>Journeying onwards, we noticed the fine cathedral and town of 
Kuttenberg, once famous for its gold and silver mines. <a 
name="citation4"></a><a href="#footnote4" class="citation">[4]</a>&nbsp; 
Next comes the great tobacco-manufactory of Sedlitz, near which we first 
see the Elbe, but only for a short time, as it soon takes another 
direction.&nbsp; Passing the small town of Collin, we are whirled close by 
the battle-field where, in the year 1757, the great King Frederick paid his
score to the Austrians.&nbsp; An obelisk, erected a few years since to the 
memory of General Daun, occupies a small eminence on the right.&nbsp; On 
the left is the plain of Klephorcz, where the Austrian army was drawn up. 
<a name="citation5"></a><a href="#footnote5" class="citation">[5]</a></p>
<p>At eleven o&rsquo;clock on the same night we reached</p>
<h3>PRAGUE.</h3>
<p>As it was my intention to pursue my journey after two days, my first 
walk on the following morning was to the police-office, to procure a 
passport and the all-important pass-warrant; my next to the custom-house, 
to take possession of a small chest, which I had delivered up five days 
before my departure, and which, as the expeditor affirmed, I should find 
ready for me on my arrival at Prague. <a name="citation6"></a><a 
href="#footnote6" class="citation">[6]</a>&nbsp; Ah, Mr. Expeditor! my 
chest was not there.&nbsp; After Saturday comes Sunday; but on Sunday the 
custom-house is closed.&nbsp; So here was a day lost, a day in which I 
might have gone to Dresden, and even visited the opera.</p>
<p>On Monday morning I once more hastened to the office in anxious 
expectation; the box was not yet there.&nbsp; An array of loaded wagons 
had, however, arrived, and in one of these it might be.&nbsp; Ah, how I 
longed to see my darling little box, in order that I might&mdash;<i>not</i>
press it to my heart, but unpack it in presence of the excise officer!</p>
<p>I took merely a cursory glance at Prague, as I had thoroughly examined 
every thing there some years before.&nbsp; The beautiful 
&ldquo;Graben&rdquo; and Horse-market once more excited my 
admiration.&nbsp; It was with a peculiar feeling that I trod the old 
bridge, from which St. John of Nepomuk was cast into the Moldau for 
refusing to publish the confession of King Wenceslaus&rsquo; consort. <a 
name="citation7"></a><a href="#footnote7" class="citation">[7]</a>&nbsp; On
the opposite bank I mounted the Hradschin, and paid a visit to the 
cathedral, in which a large sarcophagus, surrounded and borne by angels, 
and surmounted by a canopy of crimson damask, is dedicated to the memory of
the saint.&nbsp; The monument is of silver, and the worth of the metal 
alone is estimated at 80,000 florins.&nbsp; The church itself is not 
spacious, but is built in the noble Gothic style; the lesser altars, 
however, with their innumerable gilded wooden figures, look by contrast 
extremely puny.&nbsp; In the chapel are many sarcophagi, on which repose 
bishops and knights hewn in stone, but so much damaged, that many are 
without hands and feet, while some lack heads.&nbsp; To the right, at the 
entrance of the church, is the celebrated chapel of St. Wenceslaus, with 
its walls ornamented with frescoes, of which the colours and designs are 
now almost obliterated.&nbsp; It is further enriched with costly 
stones.</p>
<p>Not far from the cathedral is situated the palace of Count Czernin, a 
building particularly favoured with windows, of which it has one for every 
day in the year.&nbsp; I was there in an ordinary year, and saw 365; how 
they manage in leap-year I do not know.&nbsp; The view from the belvedere 
of this palace well repays the observer.&nbsp; It takes in the old and new 
town, the noble river with its two bridges (the ancient venerable-looking 
stone structure, and the graceful suspension-bridge, six hundred paces 
long), and the hills round about, clothed with gardens, among which appear 
neat country-houses.</p>
<p>The streets of the &ldquo;Kleinseite&rdquo; are not particularly 
attractive, being mostly tortuous, steep, and narrow.&nbsp; They contain, 
however, several remarkable palaces, among which that of Wallenstein Duke 
of Friedland stands pre-eminent. <a name="citation8"></a><a 
href="#footnote8" class="citation">[8]</a></p>
<p>After visiting St. Nicholas&rsquo; Church, remarkable for the height of 
its spire and its beautifully arched cupola, I betook myself to 
Wimmer&rsquo;s gardens, and thence to the &ldquo;Bastei,&rdquo; a place of 
public resort with the citizens of Prague.</p>
<p>I could now observe the devastation caused by the rising of the water 
shortly before my arrival.&nbsp; The Moldau had overstepped its banks in so
turbulent a manner, as to carry along with it several small houses, and 
even a little village not far from Prague, besides damaging all the 
dwellings upon its banks.&nbsp; The water had indeed already fallen, but 
the walls of the houses were soaked through and through; the doors had been
carried away, and from the broken windows no faces looked out upon the 
passers-by.&nbsp; The water had risen two feet more than in 1784, in which 
year the Moldau had also attained an unusual height.</p>
<p>From the same tower of observation, I looked down upon the great open 
space bought a few years ago, and intended to be occupied by the termini of
the Vienna and Dresden railroads.&nbsp; Although several houses were only 
just being pulled down, and the foundations of but few buildings were laid,
I was assured that within six months every thing would be completed.</p>
<p>I have still to mention a circumstance which struck me during my morning
peregrinations, namely, the curious method in which milk, vegetables, and 
other provisions are here brought to town.&nbsp; I could have fancied 
myself transported to Lapland or Greenland, on meeting every where carts to
which two, three, or four dogs were harnessed.&nbsp; One pair of dogs will 
drag three hundredweight on level ground; but when they encounter a hill, 
the driver must lend a helping hand.&nbsp; These dogs are, besides, careful
guardians; and I would not advise any one to approach a car of this kind, 
as it stands before the inn-door, while the proprietor is quenching his 
thirst within, on the money he has just earned.</p>
<p>At five o&rsquo;clock on the morning of the 15th of April I left Prague,
and rode for fourteen miles in the mail-carriage, as far as Obristwy on the
Elbe, at which place I embarked for Dresden, on board the steamer Bohemia, 
of fifty-horse power, a miserable old craft, apparently a stranger to 
beauty and comfort from her youth up.&nbsp; The price charged for this 
short passage of eight or nine hours is enormously dear.&nbsp; The 
travellers will, however, soon have their revenge on the extortionate 
proprietors; a railroad is constructing, by means of which this distance 
will be traversed in a much shorter time, and at a great saving of 
expense.</p>
<p>But at any rate the journey by water is the more agreeable; the way lies
through very picturesque scenery, and at length through &ldquo;Saxon 
Switzerland&rdquo; itself.&nbsp; The commencement of the journey is, 
however, far from pleasing.&nbsp; On the right are naked hills, and on the 
left large plains, over which, last spring, the swollen stream rolled, 
partly covering the trees and the roofs of the cottages.&nbsp; Here I could
for the first time see the whole extent of the calamity.&nbsp; Many houses 
had been completely torn down, and the crops, and even the loose alluvial 
earth swept away; as we glided by each dreary scene of devastation, another
yet more dismal would appear in its place.</p>
<p>This continued till we reached Melnick, where the trees become higher, 
and groups of houses peer forth from among the innumerable vineyards.&nbsp;
Opposite this little town the Moldau falls into the Elbe.&nbsp; On the 
left, in the far distance, the traveller can descry St. George&rsquo;s 
Mount, from which, as the story goes, Czech took possession of all 
Bohemia.</p>
<p>Below the little town of Raudnitz the hills gave place to mountains, and
as many enthusiasts can only find those regions romantic where the 
mountains are crowned with half-ruined castles and strongholds, good old 
Time has taken care to plant there two fine ruins, Hafenberg and Skalt, for
the delectation of such sentimental observers.</p>
<p>Near Leitmeritz, a small town with a handsome castle, and a church and 
convent, the Eger flows into the Elbe, and a high-arched wooden bridge 
connects the two banks.&nbsp; Here our poor sailors had difficult work to 
lower the mast and the funnel.</p>
<p>The rather pretty village of Gross-Czernoseck is remarkable for its 
gigantic cellars, hewn out of the rock.&nbsp; A post-carriage could easily 
turn round in one of these.&nbsp; The vats are of course proportioned to 
the cellars, particularly the barrels called the &ldquo;twelve 
apostles,&rdquo; each of which holds between three and four thousand 
gallons.&nbsp; It would be no more than fair to stop here awhile, to give 
every hero of the bottle an opportunity to enjoy a sight of these 
palace-cellars, and to offer a libation to the twelve apostles; but the 
steamer passed on, and we were obliged to make the most of the descriptions
furnished by those who were more at home in these parts, and had no doubt 
frequently emerged in an inspired state from the depths of the cellars in 
question.</p>
<p>The view now becomes more and more charming: the mountains appear to 
draw closer together, and shut in the bed of the stream; romantic groups of
rocks, with summits crowned by rains yet more romantic, tower 
between.&nbsp; The ancient but well-preserved castle of Schreckenstein, 
built on a rock rising boldly out of the Elbe, is particularly striking; 
the approaches to it are by serpentine walks hewn out of the rock.</p>
<p>Near the small town of Aussig we find the most considerable coal-mines 
in Bohemia.&nbsp; In their neighbourhood is situated the little mountain 
estate Paschkal, which produces a kind of wine said to resemble 
champagne.</p>
<p>The mountains now become higher and higher, but above them all towers 
the gigantic Jungfernsprung (Maiden&rsquo;s Leap).&nbsp; The beauty of this
region is only surpassed by the situation of the town and castle of 
Tetschen.&nbsp; The castle stands on a rock, between twenty and thirty feet
high, which seems to rise out of the Elbe; it is surrounded by hot-houses 
and charming gardens, shelving downwards as far as the town, which lies in 
a blooming valley, near a little harbour.&nbsp; The valley itself, 
encompassed by a chain of lofty mountains, seems quite shut out from the 
rest of the world.</p>
<p>The left bank of the river is here so crowded with masses and walls of 
rock, that there is only room at intervals for an isolated farm or 
hut.&nbsp; Suddenly the tops of masts appear between the high rocks, a 
phenomenon which is soon explained; a large gap in one of the rocky walls 
forms a beautiful basin.</p>
<p>And now we come to Schandau, a place consisting only of a few houses; it
is a frontier town of the Saxon dominions.&nbsp; Custom-house officers, a 
race of beings ever associated with frontier towns, here boarded our 
vessel, and rummaged every thing.&nbsp; My daguerreotype apparatus, which I
had locked up in a small box, was looked upon with an eye of suspicion; but
upon my assertion that it was exclusively intended for my own use, I and my
apparatus were graciously dismissed.</p>
<p>In our onward journey we frequently observed rocks of peculiar shapes, 
which have appropriate names, such as the &ldquo;Zirkelstein,&rdquo; 
&ldquo;Lilienstein,&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; The K&ouml;nigstein is a 
collection of jagged masses of rock, on which is built the fortress of the 
same name, used at present as a prison for great criminals.&nbsp; At the 
foot of the rocks lies the little town of K&ouml;nigstein.&nbsp; Not far 
off, on the right bank, a huge rock, resting on others, bears a striking 
resemblance to a human head.&nbsp; The more distant groups of rocks are 
called those of &ldquo;Rathen,&rdquo; but are considered as belonging to 
Saxon Switzerland.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Basteien&rdquo; (Bastions) of this 
Switzerland, close by which we now pass, are most wonderful superpositions 
of lofty and fantastically shaped rocks.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the steamer 
whirled us so rapidly on our way, that whilst we contemplated one bank, the
beauteous scenes on the opposite side had already glided from our 
view.&nbsp; In much too short a time we had passed the town of Pirna, 
situate at the commencement of this range of mountains.&nbsp; The very 
ancient gate of this town towers far above all the other buildings.</p>
<p>Lastly we see the great castle Sonnenstein, built on a rock, and now 
used as an asylum for lunatics.</p>
<p>All the beautiful and picturesque portion of our passage is now past, 
and the royal villa of Pillnitz, with its many Chinese gables, looks 
insignificant enough, after the grand scenes of nature.&nbsp; A chain of 
hills, covered with the country-houses of citizens, adjoins it; and on the 
right extends a large plain, at the far end of which we can dimly descry 
the Saxon metropolis.&nbsp; But what is that in the distance?&nbsp; We have
hardly time to arrange our luggage, when the anchor is let go near the fine
old Dresden Bridge.</p>
<p>This bridge had not escaped unscathed by the furious river.&nbsp; One of
the centre arches had given way, and the cross and watchbox which 
surmounted it were precipitated into the flood.&nbsp; At first, carriages 
still passed over the bridge; it was not until some time afterwards that 
the full extent of the damage was ascertained, and the passage of carriages
over the bridge discontinued for many months.</p>
<p>As I had seen the town of Dresden several years before, and the only 
building new to me was the splendid theatre, I took advantage of the few 
evening hours of my stay to visit this structure.</p>
<p>Standing in the midst of the beautiful Cathedral-square, its noble 
rotunda-like form at once rivets the attention.&nbsp; The inner theatre is 
surrounded by a superb broad and lofty corridor, with fine bow-windows and 
straight broad staircases, leading in different directions towards the 
galleries.&nbsp; The interior of the theatre is not so spacious as, judging
from the exterior, one would imagine it to be, but the architecture and 
decorations are truly gorgeous and striking.&nbsp; The boxes are all open, 
being separated from each other merely by a low partition; the walls and 
chairs are covered with heavy silken draperies, and the seats of the third 
and fourth galleries with a mixture of silk and cotton.&nbsp; One single 
circumstance was disagreeable to me in an acoustic point of view&mdash;I 
could hear the slightest whisper of the prompter as distinctly as though 
some one had been behind me reading the play.&nbsp; The curtain had 
scarcely fallen before the whole house was empty, and yet there was no 
crowding to get out.&nbsp; This first drew my attention to the numerous and
excellently contrived doors.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">April 16th.</p>
<p>The Dresden omnibuses may be cited as models of comfort; one is certain 
of plenty of room, and there is no occasion to dread either the corpulent 
persons or the furs and cloaks of fellow-passengers.&nbsp; A bell-pull is 
fixed in the interior of the carriage, so that each individual can give the
coachman a signal when he or she wishes to alight.&nbsp; These omnibuses 
call at the principal inns, and wait for a moment; but the traveller who is
not ready in advance is left behind.</p>
<p>At half-past five in the morning it called at our hotel.&nbsp; I was 
ready and waiting, and drove off comfortably to the railway.&nbsp; The 
distance from Dresden to Leipzig is reckoned at fifty-six miles, and the 
journey occupied three hours.</p>
<p>The first fourteen miles are very agreeable; gardens, fields, and 
meadows, pine-forests in the plain and on the hills, and between these, 
villages, farms, country-houses, and solitary chapels, combine to form a 
very pretty landscape.&nbsp; But the scene soon changes, and the town of 
Meissen (famous for its porcelain manufactory), on the right hand, seems to
shut out from our view all that is picturesque and beautiful.</p>
<p>From here to Leipzig we travel through a wearisome monotonous plain, 
enlivened at long intervals by villages and scattered farms.&nbsp; There is
nothing to see but a great tunnel, and the river Pleisse&mdash;the latter, 
or rather the Elster, is rendered famous by the death of Prince 
Poniatowski. <a name="citation9"></a><a href="#footnote9" 
class="citation">[9]</a></p>
<p>The town of Leipzig, celebrated far and wide for its fairs, and more for
its immense publishing trade, presents an appearance of noise and bustle 
proportionate to its commercial importance.&nbsp; I found streets, squares,
and inns alike crowded. <a name="citation10"></a><a href="#footnote10" 
class="citation">[10]</a></p>
<p>Perhaps there does not exist a town with its houses, and consequently 
its streets, so disfigured with announcements, in all sizes and shapes, 
covering its walls, and sometimes projecting several feet, as Leipzig.</p>
<p>Among the public buildings, those which pleased me most were the 
Augusteum and the B&uuml;rgerschule.&nbsp; The B&uuml;cherhalle (book-hall)
I should suppose indebted for its celebrity rather to its literary contents
than to its architectural beauty or its exterior.&nbsp; The hall itself is 
indeed large, and occupies the whole length of the building, while the 
lower story consists of several rooms.&nbsp; The hall, the chambers, and 
the exterior are all plain, and without particular decoration.&nbsp; The 
Tuchhalle (cloth-hall) is simply a large house, with spacious chambers, 
containing supplies of cloth.&nbsp; The Theatre stands on a very large 
square, and does not present a very splendid appearance, whether viewed 
from within or from without.&nbsp; The plan of having stalls in front of 
the boxes in the second and third galleries was a novelty to me.&nbsp; The 
orchestra I could only hear, but could not discover its whereabouts; most 
probably it was posted behind the scenes.&nbsp; On inquiry, I was told that
this was only done on extraordinary occasions, when the seats in the 
orchestra were converted into stalls, as was the case on the night of my 
visit.&nbsp; The play given was &ldquo;the original Tartuffe,&rdquo; a 
popular piece by Gutzkow.&nbsp; It was capitally performed.</p>
<p>In the Leipzig theatre I had a second opportunity of observing, that as 
regards the love of eating our good Saxons are not a whit behind the 
much-censured Viennese.&nbsp; In the Dresden theatre I had admired a couple
of ladies who sat next me.&nbsp; They came provided with a neat bag, 
containing a very sufficient supply of confectionery, to which they 
perseveringly applied themselves between the acts.&nbsp; But at Leipzig I 
found a delicate-looking mother and her son, a lad of fifteen or sixteen 
years, regaling themselves with more solid provisions&mdash;white bread and
small sausages.&nbsp; I could not believe my eyes, and had made up my mind 
that the sausages were artificially formed out of some kind of 
confectionery&mdash;but alas! my nose came forward but too soon, as a 
potent witness, to corroborate what I was so unwilling to believe!</p>
<p>Neither did these two episodes take place in the loftiest regions of 
Thalia&rsquo;s temple, but in the stalls of the second tier.</p>
<p>Beautiful alleys are planted round Leipzig.&nbsp; I took a walk into the
Rosenthal (Valley of Roses), which also consists of splendid avenues and 
lawns.&nbsp; A pretty coffee-house, with a very handsome alcove, built in a
semicircular form, invites the weary traveller to rest and refreshment, 
while a band of agreeable music diffuses mirth and good humour around.</p>
<p>The rest of the scenery around Leipzig presents the appearance of a vast
and monotonous plain.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">April 17th.</p>
<p>I had intended to continue my journey to Hamburgh via Berlin, but the 
weather was so cold and stormy, and the rain poured down so heavily, that I
preferred the shorter way, and proceeded by rail to Magdeburg.&nbsp; Flying
through the dismal plain past Halle, K&ouml;then, and other towns, of which
I could only discern groups of houses, we hurriedly recognised the Saale 
and the Elbe; and towards 10 o&rsquo;clock in the morning arrived at 
Magdeburg, having travelled seventy miles in three hours and a quarter.</p>
<p>As the steamer for Hamburgh was not to start until 3 o&rsquo;clock, I 
had ample time to look at the town.</p>
<p>Magdeburg is a mixed pattern of houses of ancient, medi&aelig;val, and 
modern dates.&nbsp; Particularly remarkable in this respect is the 
principal street, the &ldquo;Broadway,&rdquo; which runs through the whole 
of the town.&nbsp; Here we can see houses dating their origin from the most
ancient times; houses that have stood proof against sieges and sackings; 
houses of all colours and forms; some sporting peaked gables, on which 
stone figures may still be seen; others covered from roof to basement with 
arabesques; and in one instance I could even detect the remains of 
frescoes.&nbsp; In the very midst of these relics of antiquity would appear
a house built in the newest style.&nbsp; I do not remember ever having seen
a street which produced so remarkable an impression on me.&nbsp; The finest
building is unquestionably the venerable cathedral.&nbsp; In Italy I had 
already seen numbers of the most beautiful churches; yet I remained 
standing in mute admiration before this masterpiece of Gothic 
architecture.</p>
<p>The monument with the twelve Apostles in this church is a worthy 
memorial of the celebrated sculptor Vischer.&nbsp; In order to view it, it 
is necessary to obtain the special permission of the commandant.</p>
<p>The cathedral square is large, symmetrical, and decorated with two 
alleys of trees; it is also used as a drilling-ground for the 
soldiers&rsquo; minor manoeuvres.&nbsp; I was particularly struck with the 
number of military men to be seen here.&nbsp; Go where I would, I was sure 
to meet soldiers and officers, frequently in large companies; in time of 
war it could scarcely have been worse.&nbsp; This was an unmistakeable 
token that I was on Prussian territory.</p>
<p>The open canals, which come from all the houses, and meander through the
streets, are a great disfigurement to the town.</p>
<p>Half-past three o&rsquo;clock came only too quickly, and I betook myself
on board the steamer <i>Magdeburg</i>, of sixty-horse power, to proceed to 
Hamburgh.&nbsp; Of the passage itself I can say nothing, except that a 
journey on a river through execrable scenery is one of the most miserable 
things that can well be imagined.&nbsp; When, in addition to this, the 
weather is bad, the ship dirty, and one is obliged to pass a night on 
board, the discomfort is increased.&nbsp; It was my lot to endure all this:
the weather was bad, the ship was dirty, the distance more than 100 miles, 
so that we had the pleasant prospect of a delightful night on board the 
ship.&nbsp; There were, moreover, so many passengers, that we were forced 
to sit crowded together; so there we sat with exemplary patience, stared at
each other, and sighed bitterly.&nbsp; Order was entirely out of the 
question; no one had time to think of such a thing.&nbsp; Smoking and 
card-playing were perseveringly carried on all day and all night; it can 
easily be imagined that things did not go so quietly as at an English 
whist-party.&nbsp; The incessant rain rendered it impossible to leave the 
cabin even for a short time.&nbsp; The only consolation I had was, that I 
made the acquaintance of the amiable composer Lorzing, a circumstance which
delighted me the more, as I had always been an admirer of his beautiful 
original music.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<p>Morning dawned at length, and in a short time afterwards we reached the 
great commercial city, which, half destroyed by the dreadful conflagration 
of 1842, had risen grander and more majestic from its ashes. <a 
name="citation11"></a><a href="#footnote11" class="citation">[11]</a>&nbsp;
I took up my quarters with a cousin, who is married to the Wurtemburg 
consul, the merchant Schmidt, in whose house I spent a most agreeable and 
happy week.&nbsp; My cousin-in-law was polite enough to escort me every 
where himself, and to shew me the lions of Hamburgh.</p>
<p>First of all we visited the Exchange between the hours of one and two, 
when it is at the fullest, and therefore best calculated to impress a 
stranger with an idea of the extent and importance of the business 
transacted there.&nbsp; The building contains a hall of great size, with 
arcades and galleries, besides many large rooms, which are partly used for 
consultations, partly for the sale of refreshments.&nbsp; The most 
interesting thing of all is, however, to sit in the gallery, and looking 
downwards, to observe the continually increasing crowd passing and 
repassing each other in the immense hall and through the galleries and 
chambers, and to listen to the hubbub and noise of the thousands of eager 
voices talking at once.&nbsp; At half-past one o&rsquo;clock the hall is at
its fullest, and the noise becomes absolutely deafening; for now they are 
marking up the rates of exchange, by which the merchants regulate their 
monetary transactions.</p>
<p>Leaving the Exchange, we bent our steps towards the great harbour, and 
entering a small boat, cruised in and about it in all directions.&nbsp; I 
had resolved to count only the three-masted ships; but soon gave it up, for
their number seemed overwhelming, even without reckoning the splendid 
steamers, brigs, sloops, and craft.&nbsp; In short, I could only gaze and 
wonder, for at least 900 ships lay before me.</p>
<p>Let any one fancy an excursion amidst 900 ships, great and small, which 
lined both shores of the Elbe in tiers of three deep or more; the passing 
to and fro of countless boats busily employed in loading or unloading these
vessels; these things, together with the shouting and singing of the 
sailors, the rattling of anchors which are being weighed, and the rush and 
swell of passing steamers, combine to constitute a picture not to be 
surpassed in any city except in that metropolis of the world, London. <a 
name="citation12"></a><a href="#footnote12" class="citation">[12]</a></p>
<p>The reason of this unusual activity in the harbour lay in the severity 
of the past winter.&nbsp; Such a winter had not been experienced for 
seventy years: the Elbe and the Baltic lay for months in icy chains, and 
not a ship could traverse the frozen river, not an anchor could be weighed 
or lowered.&nbsp; It was only a short time before my arrival that the 
passage had once more become free.</p>
<p>In the neighbourhood of the harbour are situated the greater number of 
the so-called &ldquo;yards.&rdquo;&nbsp; I had read concerning them that, 
viewed from the exterior, they look like common houses; but that they 
constitute separate communities, and contain alleys and streets, serving as
the domicile of innumerable families.&nbsp; I visited several of these 
places, and can assure the reader that I saw nothing extraordinary in 
them.&nbsp; Houses with two large wings, forming an alley of from eighty to
a hundred paces in length, are to be met with in every large town; and that
a number of families should inhabit such a house is not remarkable, 
considering that they are all poor, and that each only possesses a single 
small apartment.</p>
<p>The favourite walk in the town is the &ldquo;Jungfernstieg&rdquo; 
(Maiden&rsquo;s Walk), a broad alley, extending round a spacious and 
beautiful basin of the Alster.&nbsp; On one side are splendid hotels, with 
which Hamburgh is richly provided; on the other, a number of private 
residences of equal pretensions.&nbsp; Other walks are, the 
&ldquo;Wall,&rdquo; surrounding the town, and the &ldquo;Botanical 
Garden,&rdquo; which resembles a fine park.&nbsp; The noblest building, 
distinguished alike as regards luxury, skill, tastefulness of design, and 
stability, is the Bazaar.&nbsp; It is truly a gigantic undertaking, and the
more to be admired from the fact that it is not built upon shares, but at 
the expense of a single individual, Herr Carl Sillem; the architect&rsquo;s
name is Overdick.&nbsp; The building itself is constructed entirely of 
stone, and the walls of the great room and of the hall are inlaid with 
marble.&nbsp; A lofty cupola and an immense glazed dome cover both the 
great room and the hall; the upper staircases are ornamented with beautiful
statues.&nbsp; When in the evening it is brilliantly lighted with gas, and 
further ornamented by a tasteful display of the richest wares, the 
spectator can almost fancy himself transported to a fairy palace.</p>
<p>Altogether the shops in Hamburgh are very luxurious.&nbsp; The wares lie
displayed in the most tasteful manner behind huge windows of plate-glass, 
which are often from five to six feet broad, and eight or ten feet high; a 
single sheet frequently costs 600 florins.&nbsp; This plate-glass luxury is
not confined to shops, but extends to windows generally, not only in 
Hamburgh, but also in Altona, and is also seen in the handsomest 
country-houses of the Hamburghers.&nbsp; Many a pane costs eight or ten 
florins; and the glass is insured in case of breakage, like houses in case 
of fire.</p>
<p>This display of glass is equalled by the costliness of the furniture, 
which is almost universally of mahogany; a wood which is here in such 
common use, that in some of the most elegant houses the very 
stair-banisters are constructed of it.&nbsp; Even the pilots have often 
mahogany furniture.</p>
<p>The handsomest and most frequented street is the &ldquo;Neue Wall&rdquo;
(New Wall).&nbsp; I was particularly struck with the number of shops and 
dwellings underground, to which one descends by a flight of six or eight 
stairs; an iron railing is generally placed before the entrance, to prevent
the passers-by from falling down.</p>
<p>A very practical institution is the great slaughterhouse, in which all 
cattle are killed on certain days of the week.</p>
<p>Concerning the town of Altona, I have only to observe that it appeared 
to me a continuation of Hamburgh; from which town, indeed, it is only 
separated by a wooden door.&nbsp; A very broad, handsome street, or, more 
properly speaking, an elongated square, planted with a double row of large 
trees, is the most remarkable thing about Altona, which belongs to the 
Danish Government, and is considered, after Copenhagen, the most important 
place in the kingdom.</p>
<p>It is a delicious ride to the village of Blankenese, distant nine miles 
from Hamburgh; the road lies among beautiful country-houses and large 
park-like gardens.&nbsp; Blankenese itself consists of cottages, grouped in
a picturesque manner round the S&uuml;lberg, a hill from which the 
traveller enjoys a very extended view over the great plain, in which it is 
the only elevated point.&nbsp; The course of the Elbe, as it winds at 
moderate speed towards the sea, is here to be traced almost to its 
embouchure at Cuxhaven.</p>
<p>The breadth of the Elbe at Blankenese exceeds two miles.</p>
<p>Another interesting excursion is to the &ldquo;New Mills,&rdquo; a 
little village on the Elbe, not more than half a mile from Altona, and 
inhabited only by fishermen and pilots.&nbsp; Whoever wishes to form an 
idea of Dutch prettiness and cleanliness should come here.</p>
<p>The houses are mostly one story high, neatly and tastefully built; the 
brightest of brass handles adorn the street-doors; the windows are kept 
scrupulously clean, and furnished with white curtains.</p>
<p>In Saxony I had found many dwellings of the peasantry tidy and neat 
enough, displaying at any rate more opulence than we are accustomed to find
with this class of people; but I had seen none to compete with this pretty 
village.</p>
<p>Among the peasants&rsquo; costumes, I only liked that worn by the women 
from the &ldquo;Vierlanden.&rdquo;&nbsp; They wear short full skirts of 
black stuff, fine white chemisettes with long sleeves, and coloured 
bodices, lightly fastened in front with silk cords or silver buckles.&nbsp;
Their straw hats have a most comical appearance; the brim of the hat is 
turned up in such a manner that the crown appears to have completely sunk 
in.&nbsp; Many pretty young girls dressed in this manner come to Hamburgh 
to sell flowers, and take up their position in front of the Exchange.</p>
<p>The 26th of April, the day appointed for my departure, arrived only too 
speedily.&nbsp; To part is the unavoidable fate of the traveller; but 
sometimes we part gladly, sometimes with regret.&nbsp; I need not write 
many pages to describe my feelings at the parting in Hamburgh.&nbsp; I was 
leaving behind me my last relations, my last friends.&nbsp; Now I was going
into the wide world, and among strangers.</p>
<p>At eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning I left Altona, and proceeded by 
railway to Kiel.</p>
<p>I noticed with pleasure that on this railway even the third-class 
carriages were securely covered in, and furnished with glass windows.&nbsp;
In fact, they only differed from those of the first and second class in 
being painted a different colour, and having the seats uncushioned.</p>
<p>The whole distance of seventy miles was passed in three hours; a rapid 
journey, but agreeable merely by its rapidity, for the whole neighbourhood 
presents only widely-extended plains, turf-bogs and moorlands, sandy places
and heaths, interspersed with a little meadow or arable land.&nbsp; From 
the nature of the soil, the water in the ditches and fields looked black as
ink.</p>
<p>Near Binneburg we notice a few stunted plantations of trees.&nbsp; From 
Eisholm a branch-line leads to Gl&uuml;ckstadt, and another from 
Neum&uuml;nster, a large place with important cloth-factories, to 
Rendsburg.</p>
<p>From here there is nothing to be seen but a convent, in which many Dukes
of Holstein lie buried, and several unimportant lakes; for instance, those 
of Bernsholm, Einfeld, and Schulhof.&nbsp; The little river Eider would 
have passed unnoticed by me, had not some of my fellow-passengers made a 
great feature of it.&nbsp; In the finest countries I have found the natives
far less enthusiastic about what was really grand and beautiful, than they 
were here in praise of what was neither the one nor the other.&nbsp; My 
neighbour, a very agreeable lady, was untiring in laudation of her 
beautiful native land.&nbsp; In her eyes the crippled wood was a splendid 
park, the waste moorland an inexhaustible field for contemplation, and 
every trifle a matter of real importance.&nbsp; In my heart I wished her 
joy of her fervid imagination; but unfortunately my colder nature would not
catch the infection.</p>
<p>Towards Kiel the plain becomes a region of low hills.&nbsp; Kiel itself 
is prettily situated on the Baltic, which, viewed from thence, has the 
appearance of a lake of middling size.&nbsp; The harbour is said to be 
good; but there were not many ships there. <a name="citation13"></a><a 
href="#footnote13" class="citation">[13]</a>&nbsp; Among these was the 
steamer destined to carry me to Copenhagen.&nbsp; Little did I anticipate 
the good reason I should have to remember this vessel.</p>
<p>Thanks to the affectionate forethought of my cousin Schmidt, I found one
of his relations, Herr Brauer, waiting for me at the railway.&nbsp; I was 
immediately introduced to his family, and passed the few hours of my stay 
very agreeably in their company.</p>
<p>Evening approached, and with it the hour of embarkation.&nbsp; My kind 
friends the Brauers accompanied me to the steamer, and I took a grateful 
leave of them.</p>
<p>I soon discovered the steamer <i>Christian VIII.</i>, of 180-horse 
power, to be a vessel dirtier and more uncomfortable than any with which I 
had become acquainted in my maritime excursions.&nbsp; Scrubbing and 
sweeping seemed things unknown here.&nbsp; The approach to the cabin was by
a flight of stairs so steep, that great care was requisite to avoid 
descending in an expeditious but disagreeable manner, by a fall from top to
bottom.&nbsp; In the fore-cabin there was no attempt at separate quarters 
for ladies and gentlemen.&nbsp; In short, the arrangements seemed all to 
have been made with a view of impressing the ship vividly on the 
recollection of every traveller.</p>
<p>At nine o&rsquo;clock we left Kiel.&nbsp; The day and the twilight are 
here already longer than in the lands lying to the south and the 
west.&nbsp; There was light enough to enable me to see, looming out of the 
surrounding darkness, the fortress &ldquo;Friedrichsort,&rdquo; which we 
passed at about ten o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">April 27th.</p>
<p>To-day I still rose with the sun; but that will soon be a difficult 
matter to accomplish; for in the north the goddess of light makes amends in
spring and summer for her shortcomings during the winter.&nbsp; I went on 
deck, and looked on the broad expanse of ocean.&nbsp; No land was to be 
seen; but soon a coast appeared, then disappeared, and then a new and more 
distant one rose out of the sea.&nbsp; Towards noon we reached the island 
of M&ouml;en, which lies about forty <a name="citation14"></a><a 
href="#footnote14" class="citation">[14]</a> miles distant from 
Copenhagen.&nbsp; It forms a beautiful group of rocks, rising boldly from 
the sea.&nbsp; They are white as chalk, and have a smooth and shining 
appearance.&nbsp; The highest of these walls of rock towers 400 feet above 
the level of the surrounding ocean.&nbsp; Soon we saw the coast of Sweden, 
then the island of Malm&ouml;; and at last Copenhagen itself, where we 
landed at four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon.&nbsp; The distance from Kiel
to Copenhagen is 136 sea-miles.</p>
<p>I remained seven days at Copenhagen, and should have had ample time to 
see every thing, had the weather been more favourable.&nbsp; But it blew 
and rained so violently, that I was obliged to give up all thoughts of 
visiting the surrounding parks, and was fain to content myself with seeing 
a few of the nearest walks, which I accomplished with some difficulty.</p>
<p>The first street in Copenhagen which I traversed on coming from the 
harbour generally produces a great impression.&nbsp; It is called the 
&ldquo;Broad Street,&rdquo; and leads from the harbour through the greater 
part of the town.&nbsp; In addition to its breadth it is very long and 
regular, and the splendid palaces and houses on either side give it a 
remarkably grand appearance.</p>
<p>It is a peculiar sight, when, in the midst of this fine quarter, we come
suddenly upon a ruin, a giant building resting on huge pillars, but half 
completed, and partly covered with moss and lichens.&nbsp; It was intended 
for a splendid church, and is built entirely of marble; but the soft ground
would not bear the immense weight.&nbsp; The half-finished building began 
to sink, and the completion of the undertaking became for ever 
impossible.</p>
<p>Many other streets rival the &ldquo;Broad Street&rdquo; in size and 
magnificence.&nbsp; Foremost among them comes the Amalienstrasse.&nbsp; The
most bustling, but by far not the finest, are the Oster and 
Gotherstrasse.&nbsp; To walk in these is at first quite a difficult 
undertaking for a stranger.&nbsp; On one side of the pavement, which is 
raised about a foot above the carriage-way, he comes continually in contact
with stairs, leading sometimes to warehouses above, at others to 
subterranean warehouses below the level of the street.&nbsp; The approaches
to the latter are not guarded by railings as in Hamburgh.&nbsp; The other 
side of the pavement is bounded by a little unostentatious rivulet, called 
by unpoetical people &ldquo;canal,&rdquo; into which tributaries equally 
sweet pour from all the neighbouring houses.&nbsp; It is therefore 
necessary to take great care, lest you should fall into the traitorous 
depths on the one side, or stumble over the projecting steps on the 
other.&nbsp; The pavement itself is covered with a row of stone slabs, a 
foot and a half wide, on which one walks comfortably enough.&nbsp; But then
every body contends for the possession of these, to avoid the uneven and 
pointed stones at the side.&nbsp; This, added to the dreadful crowding, 
renders the street one which would scarcely be chosen for a walk, the less 
so as the shops do not contain any thing handsome, the houses are neither 
palace-like nor even tastefully built, and the street itself is neither of 
the broadest nor of the cleanest.</p>
<p>The squares are all large and regularly built.&nbsp; The finest is the 
Kongensnytorf (King&rsquo;s New Market).&nbsp; Some fine mansions, the 
chief guard-house, the theatre, the chief coffee-houses and inns, the 
academy of the fine arts, and the building belonging to the botanical 
garden, the two last commonly known by the name of 
&ldquo;Charlottenburg,&rdquo; are among the ornaments of this magnificent 
square, in the midst of which stands a beautiful monument, representing 
Christian V. on horseback, and surrounded by several figures.</p>
<p>Smaller, but more beautiful in its perfect symmetry, is the 
&ldquo;Amalienplatz,&rdquo; containing four royal palaces, built exactly 
alike, and intersected by four broad streets in the form of a cross.&nbsp; 
This square also is decorated by a monument standing in the midst, and 
representing Frederick V.&nbsp; In another fine square, the 
&ldquo;Nytorf&rdquo; (New Market), there is a fountain.&nbsp; Its little 
statue sends forth very meagre jets of water, and the fountain is merely 
noticeable as being the only one I could find at Copenhagen.</p>
<p>The traveller can hardly fail of being surprised by the number and 
magnificence of the palaces, at sight of which he could fancy himself in 
the metropolis of one of the largest kingdoms.&nbsp; The 
&ldquo;Christianensburg&rdquo; is truly imperial; it was completely 
destroyed by fire in the year 1794, but has since been rebuilt with 
increased splendour.&nbsp; The chapel of this palace is very 
remarkable.&nbsp; The interior has the appearance rather of a concert-room 
than of a building devoted to purposes of worship.&nbsp; Tastefully 
decorated boxes, among which we notice that of the king, together with 
galleries, occupy the upper part of the chapel; the lower is filled with 
benches covered with red velvet and silk.&nbsp; The pulpit and altar are so
entirely without decoration, that, on first entering, they wholly escape 
notice.</p>
<p>In the &ldquo;Christianensburg&rdquo; is also the &ldquo;Northern 
Museum,&rdquo; peculiarly rich in specimens of the ornaments, weapons, 
musical instruments, and other mementoes of northern nations.</p>
<p>The Winter Riding-school, in which concerts are frequently given, is 
large and symmetrical.&nbsp; I admired the stalls, and yet more the grey 
horses which occupied them&mdash;descendants of the pure Arabian and wild 
Norwegian breeds&mdash;creatures with long manes and tails of fine silky 
hair.&nbsp; Every one who sees these horses, whether he be a connoisseur or
one of the uninitiated, must admire them.</p>
<p>Adjoining the &ldquo;Christianensburg&rdquo; is Thorwaldsen&rsquo;s 
Museum, a square building with fine saloons, lighted from above.&nbsp; When
I saw it, it was not completed; the walls were being painted in fresco by 
some of the first native artists.&nbsp; The sculptured treasures were 
there, but unfortunately yet unpacked.</p>
<p>In the midst of the courtyard Thorwaldsen&rsquo;s mausoleum is being 
erected.&nbsp; There his ashes will rest, with his exquisitely finished 
lion as a gravestone above them. <a name="citation15"></a><a 
href="#footnote15" class="citation">[15]</a></p>
<p>The largest among the churches is the &ldquo;Woman&rsquo;s 
Church.&rdquo;&nbsp; The building has no architectural beauty; the pillars,
galleries, and cupola are all of wood, covered with a mixture of sand and 
plaster.&nbsp; But whatever may be wanting in outward splendour is 
compensated by its contents, for this church contains the masterpieces of 
Thorwaldsen.&nbsp; At the high altar stands his glorious figure of our 
Saviour, in the niches of the wall his colossal twelve apostles.</p>
<p>In the contemplation of these works we forget the plainness of the 
building which contains them.&nbsp; May the fates be prosperous, and no 
conflagration reach this church, built as it is half of wood!</p>
<p>The Catholic Church is small, but tasteful beyond expression.&nbsp; The 
late emperor of Austria presented to it a good full-toned organ, and two 
oil-paintings, one by Kuppelweiser, the other by a pupil of this 
master.</p>
<p>In the &ldquo;Museum of Arts&rdquo; I was most interested in the ancient
chair, used in days of yore by Tycho de Brahe. <a name="citation16"></a><a 
href="#footnote16" class="citation">[16]</a></p>
<p>The Exchange is a curious ancient building.&nbsp; It is very long and 
narrow, and surmounted by nine peaks, from the centre of which protrudes a 
remarkable pointed tower, formed of four crocodiles&rsquo; tails 
intertwined.</p>
<p>The hall itself is small, low, and dark; it contains a full-length 
portrait in oil of Tycho de Brahe.&nbsp; Nearly all the upper part of the 
building is converted into a kind of bazaar, and the lower portion contains
a number of small and dingy booths.</p>
<p>Several canals, having an outlet into the sea, give a peculiar charm to 
the town.&nbsp; They are, in fact, so many markets; for the craft lying in 
them are laden with provisions of all kinds, which are here offered for 
sale.</p>
<p>The Sailors&rsquo; Town, adjoining Copenhagen, and situated near the 
harbour, is singularly neat and pretty.&nbsp; It consists of three long, 
broad, straight streets, built of houses looking so exactly alike, that on 
a foggy night an accurate knowledge of the locality is requisite to know 
one from the other.&nbsp; It looks as though, on each side of the way, 
there were only one long house of a single floor, with a building one story
high in the middle.&nbsp; In the latter dwell the commandant and 
overseers.</p>
<p>The lighting of the streets is managed in Copenhagen in the same way as 
in our smaller German towns.&nbsp; When &ldquo;moonlight&rdquo; is 
announced in the calendar, not a lamp is lighted.&nbsp; If the lady moon 
chooses to hide behind dark clouds, that is her fault.&nbsp; It would be 
insolent to attempt to supply the place of her radiance with miserable 
lamps&mdash;a wise arrangement! (?)</p>
<p>Of the near walks, the garden of the &ldquo;Rosenburg,&rdquo; within the
town, pleased me much; as did also the &ldquo;Long Line,&rdquo; an alley of
beautiful trees extending parallel with the sea, and in which one can 
either walk or ride.&nbsp; A coffee-house, in front of which there is music
in fine weather, attracts many of the loungers.&nbsp; The most beautiful 
place of all is the &ldquo;Kastell,&rdquo; above the &ldquo;Long 
Line,&rdquo; from whence one can enjoy a beautiful view.&nbsp; The town 
lies displayed below in all its magnificence: the harbour, with its many 
ships; the sparkling blue Sound, which spreads its broad expanse between 
the coasts of Denmark and Sweden, and washes many a beautiful group of 
islands belonging to one or the other of these countries.&nbsp; The 
background of the picture alone is uninteresting, as there is no chain of 
mountains to form a horizon, and the eye wanders over the boundless flats 
of Denmark.</p>
<p>Among the vessels lying at anchor in the harbour I saw but few 
three-masters, and still fewer steamers.&nbsp; The ships of the fleet 
presented a curious appearance; at the first view they look like great 
houses with flag-staves, for every ship is provided with a roof, out of 
which the masts rise into the air; they are besides very high out of the 
water, so that all the port-holes and the windows of the cabins appear in 
two or three stories, one above the other.</p>
<p>A somewhat more distant excursion, which can be very conveniently made 
in a capital omnibus, takes you to the royal chateau 
&ldquo;Friedrichsberg,&rdquo; lying before the water-gate, two miles 
distant from the town.&nbsp; Splendid avenues lead to this place, where are
to be found all the delights that can combine to draw a citizen into the 
country.&nbsp; There are a tivoli, a railway, cabinets, and booths with 
wax-figures, and countless other sights, besides coffee-houses, beer-rooms,
and music.&nbsp; The gardens are planted at the sides with a number of 
small arbours, each containing a table and chairs, and all open in front, 
so as to shew at one view all the visitors of these pretty natural 
huts.&nbsp; On Sundays, when the gardens are crowded, this is a very 
animated sight.</p>
<p>On the way to this &ldquo;Prater&rdquo; of Copenhagen, we pass many 
handsome villas, each standing in a fine garden.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p50b.jpg">
<img alt="Copenhagen: From Frederiesbourg" src="images/p50s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The royal palace is situated on the summit of a hill, at the end of the 
avenue, and is surrounded by a beautiful park; it commands a view of a 
great portion of the town, with the surrounding country and the sea; still 
I far prefer the prospect from the &ldquo;Kastell.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Park 
contains a considerable island, which, during some part of the year, stands
in the midst of an extensive lake.&nbsp; This island is appropriated to the
Court, but the rest of the park is open to the public.</p>
<p>Immediately outside the water-gate stands an obelisk, remarkable neither
for its beauty nor for the skill displayed in its erection, for it consists
of various stones, and is not high, but interesting from the circumstance 
to which it owes its origin.&nbsp; It was erected by his grateful subjects 
in memory of the late king Christian VII., to commemorate the abolition of 
feudal service.&nbsp; Surely no feeling person can contemplate without 
joyful emotion a monument like this.</p>
<p>I have here given a faithful account of what I saw during my short stay 
at Copenhagen.&nbsp; It only remains for me to describe a few peculiar 
customs of the people, and so I will begin as it were at the end, with the 
burial of the dead.&nbsp; In Denmark, as in fact in the whole of 
Scandinavia, not excepting Iceland, it is customary not to bury the dead 
until eight or ten days have elapsed.&nbsp; In winter-time this is not of 
so much consequence, but in summer it is far from healthy for those under 
the same roof with the corpse.&nbsp; I was present at Copenhagen at the 
funeral of Dr. Brandis, physician to the king.&nbsp; Two of the 
king&rsquo;s carriages and a number of private equipages attended.&nbsp; 
Nearly all these were empty, and the servants walked beside them.&nbsp; 
Among the mourners I did not notice a single woman; I supposed that this 
was only the case at the funerals of gentlemen, but on inquiry I found that
the same rule is observed at the burial of women.&nbsp; This consideration 
for the weaker sex is carried so far, that on the day of the funeral no 
woman may be seen in the house of mourning.&nbsp; The mourners assemble in 
the house of the deceased, and partake of cold refreshments.&nbsp; At the 
conclusion of the ceremony they are again regaled.&nbsp; What particularly 
pleased me in Copenhagen was, that I never on any occasion saw beggars, or 
even such miserably clad people as are found only too frequently in our 
great cities.&nbsp; Here there are no doubt poor people, as there are such 
every where else in the world, but one does not see them beg.&nbsp; I 
cannot help mentioning an arrangement which certainly deserves to be 
universally carried out;&mdash;I mean, the setting apart of many large 
houses, partly belonging to the royal family, partly to rich private people
or to companies, for the reception of poor people, who are here lodged at a
much cheaper rate than is possible in ordinary dwellings.</p>
<p>The costumes of the peasants did not particularly please me.&nbsp; The 
women wear dresses of green or black woollen stuff, reaching to the ankle, 
and trimmed at the skirt with broad coloured woollen borders.&nbsp; The 
seams of the spenser, and the arm-holes, are also trimmed with smaller 
coloured borders.&nbsp; On their heads they wear a handkerchief, and over 
this a kind of shade, like a bonnet.&nbsp; On Sundays I saw many of them in
small, pretty caps, worked with silk, with a border of lace of more than a 
hand&rsquo;s breadth, plaited very stiffly; at the back they have large 
bows of fine riband, the ends of which reach half down to their feet.&nbsp;
I found nothing very remarkable in the dress of the peasants.&nbsp; As far 
as strength and beauty were concerned, I thought these peasants were 
neither more nor less gifted than those of Austria.&nbsp; As regards the 
beauty of the fair sex, I should certainly give the preference to the 
Austrians.&nbsp; Fair hair and blue eyes predominate.</p>
<p>I saw but few soldiers; their uniforms, particularly those worn by the 
king&rsquo;s life-guards, are very handsome.</p>
<p>I especially noticed the drummers; they were all little lads of ten or 
twelve years old.&nbsp; One could almost have exclaimed, &ldquo;Drum, 
whither art thou carrying that boy?&rdquo;&nbsp; To march, and to join in 
fatiguing manoeuvres, carrying such a drum, and beating it bravely at the 
same time, is rather cruel work for such young lads.&nbsp; Many a ruined 
constitution may be ascribed to this custom.</p>
<p>During my stay in Copenhagen I spent many very delightful hours with 
Professor Mariboe and his amiable family, and with the kind clergyman of 
the embassy, Herr Zimmermann.&nbsp; They received me with true politeness 
and hospitality, and drew me into their circle, where I soon felt myself 
quite at ease.&nbsp; I shall never forget their friendship, and shall make 
use of every opportunity to shew them my appreciation of it.&nbsp; Herr 
Edouard Gottschalk and Herr Knudson have also my best thanks.&nbsp; I 
applied to the first of these gentlemen to procure me a passage to Iceland,
and he was kind enough to use his interest with Herr Knudson on my 
behalf.</p>
<p>Herr Knudson is one of the first general dealers in Copenhagen, and 
carries on a larger and more extended commerce with Iceland than any other 
house trading thither.&nbsp; He is already beginning to retire, as the 
continual journeys are becoming irksome to him; but he still owns a number 
of great and small vessels, which are partly employed in the fisheries, and
partly in bringing all kinds of articles of consumption and luxury to the 
different harbours of Iceland.</p>
<p>He himself goes in one of his ships every year, and stays a few months 
in Iceland to settle his affairs there.&nbsp; On the recommendation of Herr
Gottschalk, Herr Knudson was kind enough to give me a passage in the ship 
in which he made the journey himself; a favour which I knew how to 
value.&nbsp; It is certainly no small kindness to take a lady passenger on 
such a journey.&nbsp; Herr Knudson knew neither my fortitude nor my 
perseverance; he did not know whether I should be able to endure the 
hardships of a journey to the north, whether I would bear sea-sickness 
philosophically, or even if I had courage enough, in case of storms or bad 
weather, to abstain from annoying the captain by my fears or complaints at 
a time when he would only have too much to harass him.&nbsp; The kind man 
allowed no such considerations to influence him.&nbsp; He believed me when 
I promised to behave courageously come what might, and took me with 
him.&nbsp; Indeed his kindness went so far that it is to him I owe every 
comfort I enjoyed in Iceland, and every assistance in furthering the 
attainment of my journey&rsquo;s object.&nbsp; I could certainly not have 
commenced a voyage under better auspices.</p>
<p>All ships visiting Iceland leave Copenhagen at the end of April, or at 
the latest in the middle of May.&nbsp; After this time only one ship is 
despatched, to carry the mails of the Danish government.&nbsp; This vessel 
leaves Copenhagen in October, remains in Iceland during the winter months, 
and returns in March.&nbsp; The gain or loss of this expedition is 
distributed in shares among the merchants of Copenhagen.</p>
<p>Besides this, a French frigate comes to Iceland every spring, and 
cruises among the different harbours until the middle of August.&nbsp; She 
superintends the fishing vessels, which, attracted by the large profits of 
the fisheries, visit these seas in great numbers during the summer. <a 
name="citation17"></a><a href="#footnote17" class="citation">[17]</a></p>
<p>Opportunities of returning from Iceland occur during the summer until 
the end of September, by means of the merchant-ships, which carry freights 
from the island to Denmark, England, and Spain.</p>
<p>At length, on Sunday the 4th of May, a favourable wind sprung up.&nbsp; 
Herr Knudson sent me word to be ready to embark at noon on board the fine 
brig <i>John</i>.</p>
<p>I immediately proceeded on board.&nbsp; The anchor was weighed, and the 
sails, unfolding themselves like giant wings, wafted us gently out of the 
harbour of Copenhagen.&nbsp; No parting from children, relations, or 
old-cherished friends embittered this hour.&nbsp; With a glad heart I bade 
adieu to the city, in the joyful hope soon to see the fulfilment of my 
long-expected journey.</p>
<p>The bright sky smiled above us, and a most favourable wind filled our 
sails.&nbsp; I sat on deck and revelled in the contemplation of scenes so 
new to me.&nbsp; Behind us lay spread the majestic town; before us the 
Sound, an immense natural basin, which I could almost compare to a great 
Swiss lake; on the right and left were the coasts of Sweden and Denmark, 
which here approach each other so closely that they seem to oppose a 
barrier to the further progress of the adventurous voyager.</p>
<p>Soon we passed the little Swedish town of Carlscrona, and the desolate 
island Hveen, on which Tycho de Brahe passed the greater portion of his 
life, occupied with stellar observations and calculations.&nbsp; Now came a
somewhat dangerous part, and one which called into action all the careful 
seamanship of the captain to bring us safely through the confined sea and 
the strong current,&mdash;the entrance of the Sound into the Cattegat.</p>
<p>The two coasts here approach to within a mile of each other.&nbsp; On 
the Swedish side lies the pretty little town of Helsingborg, on the Danish 
side that of Helsing&ouml;r, and at the extremity of a projecting neck of 
land the fortress Kronburg, which demands a toll of every passing ship, and
shews a large row of threatening cannon in case of non-compliance.&nbsp; 
Our toll had already been paid before leaving Copenhagen; we had been 
accurately signalled, and sailed fearlessly by. <a name="citation18"></a><a
href="#footnote18" class="citation">[18]</a></p>
<p>The entrance once passed, we entered the Cattegat, which already looked 
more like the great ocean: the coasts retired on each side, and most of the
shifts and barques, which till now had hovered around us on all sides, bade
us &ldquo;farewell.&rdquo;&nbsp; Some bent their course towards the east, 
others towards the west; and we alone, on the broad desert ocean, set sail 
for the icy north.&nbsp; Twilight did not set in until 9 o&rsquo;clock at 
night; and on the coasts the flaming beacons flashed up, to warn the 
benighted mariner of the proximity of dangerous rocks.</p>
<p>I now offered up my thanksgiving to Heaven for the protection hitherto 
vouchsafed me, with a humble prayer for its continuance.&nbsp; Then I 
descended to the cabin, where I found a convenient bunk (a kind of crib 
fixed to the side of the ship); I laid myself down, and was soon in a deep 
and refreshing sleep.</p>
<p>I awoke full of health and spirits, which, however, I enjoyed but for a 
short time.&nbsp; During the night we had left behind us the 
&ldquo;Cattegat&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Skagerrack,&rdquo; and were driving 
through the stormy German Ocean.&nbsp; A high wind, which increased almost 
to a gale, tumbled our poor ship about in such a manner, that none but a 
good dancer could hope to maintain an upright position.&nbsp; I had 
unfortunately been from my youth no votary of Terpsichore, and what was I 
to do?&nbsp; The naiads of this stormy region seized me, and bandied me to 
and fro, until they threw me into the arms of what was, according to my 
experience, if not exactly after Schiller&rsquo;s interpretation, 
&ldquo;the horrible of horrors,&rdquo;&mdash;sea-sickness.&nbsp; At first I
took little heed of this, thinking that sea-sickness would soon be overcome
by a traveller like myself, who should be inured to every thing.&nbsp; But 
in vain did I bear up; I became worse and worse, till I was at length 
obliged to remain in my berth with but one consoling thought, namely, that 
we were to-day on the open sea, where there was nothing worthy of 
notice.&nbsp; But the following day the Norwegian coast was in sight, and 
at all hazards I must see it; so I crawled on deck more dead than alive, 
looked at a row of mountains of moderate elevation, their tops at this 
early season still sparkling with their snowy covering, and then hurried 
back, benumbed by the piercing icy wind, to my good warm feather-bed.&nbsp;
Those who have never experienced it can have no conception of the biting, 
penetrating coldness of a gale of wind in the northern seas.&nbsp; The sun 
shone high in the heavens; the thermometer (I always calculate according to
Reaumur) stood 3&deg; above zero; I was dressed much more warmly than I 
should have thought necessary when, in my fatherland, the thermometer was 
8&deg; or 10&deg; <i>below</i> zero, and yet I felt chilled to the heart, 
and could have fancied that I had no clothes on at all.</p>
<p>On the fourth night we sailed safely past the Shetland Islands; and on 
the evening of the fifth day we passed so near the majestic rocky group of 
the Feroe Islands, that we were at one time apprehensive of being cast upon
the rocks by the unceasing gale. <a name="citation19"></a><a 
href="#footnote19" class="citation">[19]</a></p>
<p>Already on the seventh day we descried the coast of Iceland.&nbsp; Our 
passage had been unprecedentedly quick; the sailors declared that a 
favourable gale was to be preferred even to steam, and that on our present 
voyage we should certainly have left every steamer in our wake.&nbsp; But 
I, wretched being that I was, would gladly have dispensed with the services
both of gale and steam for the sake of a few hours&rsquo; rest.&nbsp; My 
illness increased so much, that on the seventh day I thought I must 
succumb.&nbsp; My limbs were bathed in a cold perspiration; I was as weak 
as an infant, and my mouth felt parched and dry.&nbsp; I saw that I must 
now either make a great effort or give up entirely; so I roused myself, and
with the assistance of the cabin-boy gained a seat, and promised to take 
any and every remedy which should be recommended.&nbsp; They gave me 
hot-water gruel with wine and sugar; but it was not enough to be obliged to
force this down, I was further compelled to swallow small pieces of raw 
bacon highly peppered, and even a mouthful of rum.&nbsp; I need not say 
what strong determination was required to make me submit to such a 
regimen.&nbsp; I had, however, but one choice, either to conquer my 
repugnance or give myself up a victim to sea-sickness; so with all patience
and resignation I received the proffered gifts, and found, after a trial of
many hours, that I could manage to retain a small dose.&nbsp; This 
physicking was continued for two long, long days, and then I began slowly 
to recover.</p>
<p>I have here circumstantially described both my illness and its cure, 
because so many people are unfortunately victims to the complaint, and when
under its influence cannot summon resolution to take sustenance.&nbsp; I 
should advise all my friends not to hold out so long as I did, but to take 
food at once, and continue to do so until the system will receive it.</p>
<p>As I was now convalescent, I tried to recruit my wearied mind by a 
diligent study of the mode of life and customs of the mariners of the 
northern seas.</p>
<p>Our ship&rsquo;s company consisted of Herr Knudson, Herr Br&uuml;ge (a 
merchant whom we were to land at the Westmann Islands), the captain, the 
mate, and six or seven sailors.&nbsp; Our mode of life in the cabin was as 
follows: in the morning, at seven o&rsquo;clock, we took coffee, but whence
this coffee came, heaven knows!&nbsp; I drank it for eleven days, and could
never discover any thing which might serve as a clue in my attempt to 
discover the country of its growth.&nbsp; At ten o&rsquo;clock we had a 
meal consisting of bread and butter and cheese, with cold beef or pork, all
excellent dishes for those in health; the second course of this morning 
meal was &ldquo;tea-water.&rdquo;&nbsp; In Scandinavia, by the way, they 
never say, &ldquo;I drink <i>tea</i>,&rdquo; the word &ldquo;water&rdquo; 
is always added: &ldquo;I drink <i>tea-water</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Our 
&ldquo;tea-water&rdquo; was, if possible, worse than its predecessor, the 
incomparable coffee.&nbsp; Thus I was beaten at all points; the eatables 
were too strong for me, the drinkables too&mdash;too&mdash;I can find no 
appropriate epithet&mdash;probably too artificial.&nbsp; I consoled myself 
with the prospect of dinner; but, alas, too soon this sweet vision faded 
into thin air!&nbsp; On the sixth day I made my first appearance at the 
covered table, and could not help at once remarking the cloth which had 
been spread over it.&nbsp; At the commencement of our journey it might 
perhaps have been white; now it was most certainly no longer of that snowy 
hue.&nbsp; The continual pitching and rolling of the ship had caused each 
dish to set its peculiar stamp upon the cloth.&nbsp; A sort of wooden 
network was now laid upon it, in the interstices of which the plates and 
glasses were set, and thus secured from falling.&nbsp; But before placing 
it on the table, our worthy cabin-boy took each plate and glass separately,
and polished it on a towel which hung near, and in colour certainly rather 
resembling the dingy floor of the cabin than the bight-hued rainbow.&nbsp; 
This could still have been endured, but the article in question really did 
duty <i>as a towel</i> in the morning, before extending its salutary 
influence over plates and glasses for the remainder of the day.</p>
<p>On making discoveries such as these, I would merely turn away my eyes, 
and try to think that perhaps <i>my glass</i> and <i>my plate</i> would be 
more delicately manipulated, or probably escape altogether; and then I 
would turn my whole attention to the expected dishes.</p>
<p>First came soup; but instead of gravy-soup, it was water-soup, with rice
and dried plums.&nbsp; This, when mingled with red wine and sugar, formed a
most exquisite dish for Danish appetites, but it certainly did not suit 
mine.&nbsp; The second and concluding course consisted of a large piece of 
beef, with which I had no fault to find, except that it was too heavy for 
one in my weak state of health.&nbsp; At supper we had the same dishes as 
at dinner, and each meal was followed by &ldquo;tea-water.&rdquo;&nbsp; At 
first I could not fancy this bill of fare at all; but within a few days 
after my convalesence, I had accustomed myself to it, and could bear the 
sea-diet very well. <a name="citation20"></a><a href="#footnote20" 
class="citation">[20]</a></p>
<p>As the rich owner of the vessel was on board, there was no lack of the 
best wines, and few evenings passed on which a bowl of punch was not 
emptied.&nbsp; There was, however, a reason found why every bottle of wine 
or bowl of punch should be drunk: for instance, at our embarkation, to 
drink the health of the friends we were leaving, and to hope for a quick 
and prosperous voyage; then, when the wind was favourable, its health was 
drunk, with the request that it would remain so; when it was contrary, with
the request that it would change; when we saw land, we saluted it with a 
glass of wine, or perhaps with several, but I was too ill to count; when we
lost sight of it, we drank a farewell glass to its health: so that every 
day brought with it three or four distinct and separate occasions for 
drinking wine. <a name="citation21"></a><a href="#footnote21" 
class="citation">[21]</a></p>
<p>The sailors drank tea-water without sugar every morning and evening, 
with the addition of a glass of brandy; for dinner they had pease, beans, 
barley, or potatoes, with salted cod, bacon, &ldquo;or junk;&rdquo; good 
sea-biscuit they could get whenever they chose.</p>
<p>The diet is not the worst part of these poor people&rsquo;s 
hardships.&nbsp; Their life may be called a continual fight against the 
elements; for it is precisely during the most dreadful storms, with rain 
and piercing cold, that they have to be continually upon deck.&nbsp; I 
could not sufficiently admire the coolness, or rather the cheerfulness and 
alacrity with which they fulfilled their onerous duties.&nbsp; And what 
reward have they?&nbsp; Scanty pay, for food the diet I have just 
described, and for their sleeping-place the smallest and most inconvenient 
part of the ship, a dark place frequently infested with vermin, and 
smelling offensively from being likewise used as a receptacle for 
oil-colours, varnish, tar, salt-fish, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
<p>To be cheerful in the midst of all this requires a very quiet and 
contented mind.&nbsp; That the Danish sailors are contented, I had many 
opportunities of observing during the voyage of which I am speaking, and on
several other occasions.</p>
<p>But after all this long description, it is high time that I should 
return to the journey itself.</p>
<p>The favourable gale which had thus wafted us to the coast of Iceland 
within seven days, now unfortunately changed its direction, and drove us 
back.&nbsp; We drifted about in the storm-tost ocean, and many a Spanish 
wave <a name="citation22"></a><a href="#footnote22" 
class="citation">[22]</a> broke completely over our ship.&nbsp; Twice we 
attempted to approach the Westmann Islands <a name="citation23"></a><a 
href="#footnote23" class="citation">[23]</a> (a group belonging to Iceland)
to watch an opportunity of casting anchor, and setting ashore our 
fellow-traveller Herr Br&uuml;ge; but it was in vain, we were driven back 
each time.&nbsp; At length, at the close of the eleventh day, we reached 
Havenfiord, a very good harbour, distant nine miles from Reikjavik, the 
capital of Iceland.</p>
<p>In spite of the very inopportune change in the direction of the wind, we
had had an unprecedentedly quick passage.&nbsp; The distance from 
Copenhagen to Iceland, in a straight line, is reckoned at 1200 geographical
miles; for a sailing vessel, which must tack now and then, and must go as 
much with the wind as possible, 1500 to 1600 miles.&nbsp; Had the strong 
wind, which was at first so favourable, instead of changing on the seventh 
day, held on for thirty or forty hours longer, we should have landed in 
Iceland on the eighth or ninth day&mdash;even the steamer could not have 
accomplished the passage so quickly.</p>
<p>The shores of Iceland appeared to me quite different from what I had 
supposed them to be from the descriptions I had read.&nbsp; I had fancied 
them naked, without tree or shrub, dreary and desert; but now I saw green 
hills, shrubs, and even what appeared to be groups of stunted trees.&nbsp; 
As we came nearer, however, I was enabled to distinguish objects more 
clearly, and the green hills became human dwellings with small doors and 
windows, while the supposed groups of trees proved in reality to be heaps 
of lava, some ten or twelve feet high, thickly covered with moss and 
grass.&nbsp; Every thing was new and striking to me; I waited in great 
impatience till we could land.</p>
<p>At length the anchor descended; but it was not till next morning that 
the hour of disembarkation and deliverance came.</p>
<p>But one more night, and then, every difficulty overcome, I should tread 
the shores of Iceland, the longed-for, and bask as it were in the wonders 
of this island, so poor in the creations of art, so rich in the phenomena 
of Nature.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>Before I land in Iceland, I must trouble the reader with a few 
preliminary observations regarding this island.&nbsp; They are drawn from 
Mackenzie&rsquo;s <i>Description of Iceland</i>, a book the sterling value 
of which is appreciated every where. <a name="citation24"></a><a 
href="#footnote24" class="citation">[24]</a></p>
<p>The discovery of Iceland, about the year of our Lord 860, is attributed 
to the spirit of enterprise of some Swedish and Norwegian pirates, who were
drifted thither on a voyage to the Feroe Isles.&nbsp; It was not till the 
year 874 that the island was peopled by a number of voluntary emigrants, 
who, feeling unhappy under the dominion of Harold Harfraga (fine hair), 
arrived at the island under the direction of Ingold. <a 
name="citation25"></a><a href="#footnote25" class="citation">[25]</a>&nbsp;
As the newcomers are said to have found no traces of dwellings, they are 
presumed to be the first who took possession of the island.</p>
<p>At this time Iceland was still so completely covered with underwood, 
that at some points it was necessary to cut a passage.&nbsp; Bringing with 
them their language, religion, customs, and historical monuments, the 
Norwegians introduced a kind of feudal system, which, about the year 928, 
gave place to a somewhat aristocratic government, retaining, however, the 
name of a republic.&nbsp; The island was divided into four provinces, over 
each of which was placed an hereditary governor or judge.</p>
<p>The General Assembly of Iceland (called Allthing) was held annually on 
the shores of the Lake Thingvalla.&nbsp; The people possessed an excellent 
code of laws, in which provision had been made for every case which could 
occur.</p>
<p>This state of things lasted for more than 300 years, a period which may 
be called the golden age of Iceland.&nbsp; Education, literature, and even 
refined poetry flourished among the inhabitants, who took part in commerce 
and in the sea-voyages which the Norwegians undertook for purposes of 
discovery.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Sagas,&rdquo; or histories of this country, contain many 
tales of personal bravery.&nbsp; Its bards and historians visited other 
climes, became the favourites of monarchs, and returned to their island 
covered with honour and loaded with presents.&nbsp; The <i>Edda</i>, by 
S&auml;mund, is one of the most valued poems of the ancient days of 
Iceland.&nbsp; The second portion of the <i>Edda</i>, called <i>Skalda</i>,
dates from a later period, and is ascribed by many to the celebrated Snorri
Sturluson.&nbsp; Isleif, first Bishop of Skalholt, was the earliest 
Icelandic historian; after him came the noted Snorri Sturluson, born in 
1178, who became the richest and mightiest man in Iceland.</p>
<p>Snorri Sturluson was frequently followed to the General Assembly of 
Iceland by a splendid retinue of 800 armed men.&nbsp; He was a great 
historian and poet, and possessed an accurate knowledge of the Greek and 
Latin tongues, besides being a powerful orator.&nbsp; He was also the 
author of the <i>Heims-kringla</i>.</p>
<p>The first school was founded at Skalholt, about the middle of the 
eleventh century, under Isleif, first Bishop of Iceland; four other schools
and several convents soon followed.&nbsp; Poetry and music seem to have 
formed a staple branch of education.</p>
<p>The climate of Iceland appears to have been less inclement than is now 
the case; corn is said to have grown, and trees and shrubs were larger and 
thicker than we find them at present.&nbsp; The population of Iceland was 
also much more numerous than it is now, although there were neither towns 
nor villages.&nbsp; The people lived scattered throughout the island; and 
the General Assembly was held at Thingvalla, in the open air.</p>
<p>Fishing constituted the chief employment of the Icelanders.&nbsp; Their 
clothing was woven from the wool of their sheep.&nbsp; Commerce with 
neighbouring countries opened to them another field of occupation.</p>
<p>The doctrines of Christianity were first introduced into Iceland, in the
year 981, by Friederich, a Saxon bishop.&nbsp; Many churches were built, 
and tithes established for the maintenance of the clergy.&nbsp; Isleif, 
first Bishop of Skalholt, was ordained in the year 1057.&nbsp; After the 
introduction of Christianity, all the Icelanders enjoyed an unostentatious 
but undisturbed practice of their religion.</p>
<p>Greenland and the most northern part of America are said to have been 
discovered by Icelanders.</p>
<p>In the middle of the thirteenth century Iceland came into the power of 
the Norwegian kings.&nbsp; In the year 1380 Norway was united to the crown 
of Denmark; and Iceland incorporated, without resistance, in the Danish 
monarchy.&nbsp; Since the cession of the island to Norway, and then to 
Denmark, peace and security took the place of the internal commotions with 
which, before this time, Iceland had been frequently disturbed; but this 
state of quiet brought forth indolence and apathy.&nbsp; The voyages of 
discovery were interfered with by the new government, and the commerce 
gradually passed into the hands of other nations.&nbsp; The climate appears
also to have changed; and the lessened industry and want of perseverance in
the inhabitants have brought agriculture completely into decline.</p>
<p>In the year 1402 the plague broke out upon the island, and carried off 
two-thirds of the population.</p>
<p>The first printing-press was established at Hoolum, about the year 1530,
under the superintendence of the Bishop, John Areson.</p>
<p>The reformation in the Icelandic Church was not brought about without 
disturbance.&nbsp; It was legally established in the year 1551.</p>
<p>During the fifteenth century the Icelanders suffered more from the 
piratical incursions of foreigners.&nbsp; As late as the year 1616 the 
French and English nations took part in these enormities.&nbsp; The most 
melancholy occurrence of this kind took place in 1627, in which year a 
great number of Algerine pirates made a descent upon the Icelandic coast, 
murdered about fifty of the inhabitants, and carried off nearly 400 others 
into captivity. <a name="citation26"></a><a href="#footnote26" 
class="citation">[26]</a></p>
<p>The eighteenth century commenced with a dreadful mortality from the 
smallpox; of which disease more than 16,000 of the inhabitants died.&nbsp; 
In 1757 a famine swept away about 10,000 souls.</p>
<p>The year 1783 was distinguished by most dreadful volcanic outbreaks in 
the interior of the island.&nbsp; Tremendous streams of lava carried all 
before them; great rivers were checked in their course, and formed 
lakes.&nbsp; For more than a year a thick cloud of smoke and volcanic ashes
covered the whole of Iceland, and nearly darkened the sunlight.&nbsp; 
Horned cattle, sheep, and horses were destroyed; famine came, with its 
accompanying illnesses; and once more appeared the malignant 
small-pox.&nbsp; In a few years more than 11,000 persons had died; more 
than one-fourth of the whole present population of the island.</p>
<p>Iceland lies in the Atlantic ocean; its greatest breadth is 240 
geographical miles, and its extreme length from north to south 140 
miles.&nbsp; The number of inhabitants is estimated at 48,000, and the 
superficial extent of the island at 29,800 square miles.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<p>On the morning of the 16th of May I landed in the harbour of Havenfiord,
and for the first time trod the shores of Iceland.&nbsp; Although I was 
quite bewildered by sea-sickness, and still more by the continual rocking 
of the ship, so that every object round me seemed to dance, and I could 
scarcely make a firm step, still I could not rest in the house of Herr 
Knudson, which he had obligingly placed at my disposal.&nbsp; I must go out
at once, to see and investigate every thing.&nbsp; I found that Havenfiord 
consisted merely of three wooden houses, a few magazines built of the same 
material, and some peasants&rsquo; cottages.</p>
<p>The wooden houses are inhabited by merchants or by their factors, and 
consist only of a ground-floor, with a front of four or six windows.&nbsp; 
Two or three steps lead up to the entrance, which is in the centre of the 
building, and opens upon a hall from which doors lead into the rooms to the
right and left.&nbsp; At the back of the house is situated the kitchen, 
which opens into several back rooms and into the yard.&nbsp; A house of 
this description consists only of five or six rooms on the ground-floor and
a few small attic bedrooms.</p>
<p>The internal arrangements are quite European.&nbsp; The 
furniture&mdash;which is often of mahogany,&mdash;the mirrors, the 
cast-iron stoves, every thing, in short, come from Copenhagen.&nbsp; 
Beautiful carpets lie spread before the sofas; neat curtains shade the 
windows; English prints ornament the whitewashed walls; porcelain, plate, 
cut-glass, &amp;c., are displayed on chests and on tables; and flower-pots 
with roses, mignonnette, and pinks spread a delicious fragrance 
around.&nbsp; I even found a grand pianoforte here.&nbsp; If any person 
could suddenly, and without having made the journey, be transported into 
one of these houses, he would certainly fancy himself in some continental 
town, rather than in the distant and barren island of Iceland.&nbsp; And as
in Havenfiord, so I found the houses of the more opulent classes in 
Reikjavik, and in all the places I visited.</p>
<p>From these handsome houses I betook myself to the cottages of the 
peasants, which have a more indigenous, Icelandic appearance.&nbsp; Small 
and low, built of lava, with the interstices filled with earth, and the 
whole covered with large pieces of turf, they would present rather the 
appearance of natural mounds of earth than of human dwellings, were it not 
that the projecting wooden chimneys, the low-browed entrances, and the 
almost imperceptible windows, cause the spectator to conclude that they are
inhabited.&nbsp; A dark narrow passage, about four feet high, leads on one 
side into the common room, and on the other to a few compartments, some of 
which are used as storehouses for provisions, and the rest as winter 
stables for the cows and sheep.&nbsp; At the end of this passage, which is 
purposely built so low, as an additional defence against the cold, the 
fireplace is generally situated.&nbsp; The rooms of the poorer class have 
neither wooden walls nor floors, and are just large enough to admit of the 
inhabitants sleeping, and perhaps turning round in them.&nbsp; The whole 
interior accommodation is comprised in bedsteads with very little covering,
a small table, and a few drawers.&nbsp; Beds and chests of drawers answer 
the purpose of benches and chairs.&nbsp; Above the beds are fixed rods, 
from which depend clothes, shoes, stockings, &amp;c.&nbsp; A small board, 
on which are arranged a few books, is generally to be observed.&nbsp; 
Stoves are considered unnecessary; for as the space is very confined, and 
the house densely populated, the atmosphere is naturally warm.</p>
<p>Rods are also placed round the fireplace, and on these the wet clothes 
and fishes are hung up in company to dry.&nbsp; The smoke completely fills 
the room, and slowly finds its way through a few breathing-holes into the 
open air.</p>
<p>Fire-wood there is none throughout the whole island.&nbsp; The rich 
inhabitants have it brought from Norway or Denmark; the poor burn turf, to 
which they frequently add bones and other offal of fish, which naturally 
engender a most disagreeable smoke.</p>
<p>On entering one of these cottages, the visitor is at a loss to determine
which of the two is the more obnoxious&mdash;the suffocating smoke in the 
passage or the poisoned air of the dwelling-room, rendered almost 
insufferable by the crowding together of so many persons.&nbsp; I could 
almost venture to assert, that the dreadful eruption called Lepra, which is
universal throughout Iceland, owes its existence rather to the total want 
of cleanliness than to the climate of the country or to the food.</p>
<p>Throughout my subsequent journeys into the interior, I found the 
cottages of the peasants every where alike squalid and filthy.&nbsp; Of 
course I speak of the majority, and not of the exceptions; for here I found
a few rich peasants, whose dwellings looked cleaner and more habitable, in 
proportion to the superior wealth or sense of decency of the owners.&nbsp; 
My idea is, that the traveller&rsquo;s estimate of a country should be 
formed according to the habits and customs of the generality of its 
inhabitants, and not according to the doings of a few individuals, as is 
often the case.&nbsp; Alas, how seldom did I meet with these creditable 
exceptions!</p>
<p>The neighbourhood of Havenfiord is formed by a most beautiful and 
picturesque field of lava, at first rising in hills, then sinking into 
hollows, and at length terminating in a great plain which extends to the 
base of the neighbouring mountains.&nbsp; Masses of the most varied forms, 
often black and naked, rise to the height of ten or fifteen feet, forming 
walls, ruined pillars, small grottoes, and hollow spaces.&nbsp; Over these 
latter large slabs often extend, and form bridges.&nbsp; Every thing around
consists of suddenly cooled heaped-up masses of lava, in some instances 
covered to their summits with grass and moss; this circumstance gives them,
as already stated, the appearance of groups of stunted trees.&nbsp; Horses,
sheep, and cows were clambering about, diligently seeking out every green 
place.&nbsp; I also clambered about diligently; I could not tire of gazing 
and wondering at this terribly beautiful picture of destruction.</p>
<p>After a few hours I had so completely forgotten the hardships of my 
passage, and felt myself so much strengthened, that I began my journey to 
Reikjavik at five o&rsquo;clock on the evening of the same day.&nbsp; Herr 
Knudson seemed much concerned for me; he warned me that the roads were bad,
and particularly emphasised the dangerous abysses I should be compelled to 
pass.&nbsp; I comforted him with the assurance that I was a good 
horsewoman, and could hardly have to encounter worse roads than those with 
which I had had the honour to become acquainted in Syria.&nbsp; I therefore
took leave of the kind gentleman, who intended to stay a week or ten days 
in Havenfiord, and mounting a small horse, set out in company of a female 
guide.</p>
<p>In my guide I made the acquaintance of a remarkable antiquity of 
Iceland, who is well worthy that I should devote a few words to her 
description.&nbsp; She is above seventy years of age, but looks scarcely 
fifty; her head is surrounded by tresses of rich fair hair.&nbsp; She is 
dressed like a man; undertakes, in the capacity of messenger, the longest 
and most fatiguing journeys; rows a boat as skilfully as the most practised
fisherman; and fulfils all her missions quicker and more exactly than a 
man, for she does not keep up so good an understanding with the 
brandy-bottle.&nbsp; She marched on so sturdily before me, that I was 
obliged to incite my little horse to greater speed with my riding-whip.</p>
<p>At first the road lay between masses of lava, where it certainly was not
easy to ride; then over flats and small acclivities, from whence we could 
descry the immense plain in which are situated Havenfiord, Bassast&auml;dt,
Reikjavik, and other places.&nbsp; Bassast&auml;dt, a town built on a 
promontory jutting out into the sea, contains one of the principal schools,
a church built of masonry, and a few cottages.&nbsp; The town of Reikjavik 
cannot be seen, as it is hidden behind a hill.&nbsp; The other places 
consist chiefly of a few cottages, and only meet the eye of the traveller 
when he approaches them nearly.&nbsp; Several chains of mountains, towering
one above the other, and sundry &ldquo;Jokuls,&rdquo; or glaciers, which 
lay still sparkling in their wintry garb, surround this interminable plain,
which is only open at one end, towards the sea.&nbsp; Some of the plains 
and hills shone with tender green, and I fancied I beheld beautiful 
meadows.&nbsp; On a nearer inspection, however, they proved to be swampy 
places, and hundreds upon hundreds of little acclivities, sometimes 
resembling mole-hills, at others small graves, and covered with grass and 
moss.</p>
<p>I could see over an area of at least thirty or forty miles, and yet 
could not descry a tree or a shrub, a bit of meadow-land or a friendly 
village.&nbsp; Every thing seemed dead.&nbsp; A few cottages lay scattered 
here and there; at long intervals a bird would hover in the air, and still 
more seldom I heard the kindly greeting of a passing inhabitant.&nbsp; 
Heaps of lava, swamps, and turf-bogs surrounded me on all sides; in all the
vast expanse not a spot was to be seen through which a plough could be 
driven.</p>
<p>After riding more than four miles, I reached a hill, from which I could 
see Reikjavik, the chief harbour, and, in fact, the only town on the 
island.&nbsp; But I was deceived in my expectations; the place before me 
was a mere village.</p>
<p>The distance from Havenfiord to Reikjavik is scarcely nine miles; but as
I was unwilling to tire my good old guide, I took three hours to accomplish
it.&nbsp; The road was, generally speaking, very good, excepting in some 
places, where it lay over heaps of lava.&nbsp; Of the much-dreaded dizzy 
abysses I saw nothing; the startling term must have been used to designate 
some unimportant declivities, along the brow of which I rode, in sight of 
the sea; or perhaps the &ldquo;abysses&rdquo; were on the lava-fields, 
where I sometimes noticed small chasms of fifteen or sixteen feet in depth 
at the most.</p>
<p>Shortly after eight o&rsquo;clock in the evening I was fortunate enough 
to reach Reikjavik safe and well.&nbsp; Through the kind forethought of 
Herr Knudson, a neat little room had been prepared for me in one of his 
houses occupied by the family of the worthy baker Bernh&ouml;ft, and truly 
I could not have been better received any where.</p>
<p>During my protracted stay the whole family of the Bernh&ouml;fts shewed 
me more kindness and cordiality than it has been my lot frequently to 
find.&nbsp; Many an hour has Herr Bernh&ouml;ft sacrificed to me, in order 
to accompany me in my little excursions.&nbsp; He assisted me most 
diligently in my search for flowers, insects, and shells, and was much 
rejoiced when he could find me a new specimen.&nbsp; His kind wife and dear
children rivalled him in willingness to oblige.&nbsp; I can only say, may 
Heaven requite them a thousand-fold for their kindness and friendship!</p>
<p>I had even an opportunity of hearing my native language spoken by Herr 
Bernh&ouml;ft, who was a Holsteiner by birth, and had not quite forgotten 
our dear German tongue, though he had lived for many years partly in 
Denmark, partly in Iceland.</p>
<p>So behold me now in the only town in Iceland, <a 
name="citation27"></a><a href="#footnote27" class="citation">[27]</a> the 
seat of the so-called cultivated classes, whose customs and mode of life I 
will now lay before my honoured readers.</p>
<p>Nothing was more disagreeable to me than a certain air of dignity 
assumed by the ladies here; an air which, except when it is natural, or has
become so from long habit, is apt to degenerate into stiffness and 
incivility.&nbsp; On meeting an acquaintance, the ladies of Reikjavik would
bend their heads with so stately and yet so careless an air as we should 
scarcely assume towards the humblest stranger.&nbsp; At the conclusion of a
visit, the lady of the house only accompanies the guest as far as the 
chamber-door.&nbsp; If the husband be present, this civility is carried a 
little further; but when this does not happen to be the case, a stranger 
who does not know exactly through which door he can make his exit, may 
chance to feel not a little embarrassed.&nbsp; Excepting in the house of 
the &ldquo;Stiftsamtmann&rdquo; (the principal official on the island), one
does not find a footman who can shew the way.&nbsp; In Hamburgh I had 
already noticed the beginnings of this dignified coldness; it increased as 
I journeyed further north, and at length reached its climax in Iceland.</p>
<p>Good letters of recommendation often fail to render the northern 
grandees polite towards strangers.&nbsp; As an instance of this fact, I 
relate the following trait:</p>
<p>Among other kind letters of recommendation, I had received one addressed
to Herr von H---, the &ldquo;Stiftsamtmann&rdquo; of Iceland.&nbsp; On my 
arrival at Copenhagen, I heard that Herr von H--- happened to be 
there.&nbsp; I therefore betook myself to his residence, and was shewn into
a room where I found two young ladies and three children.&nbsp; I delivered
my letter, and remained quietly standing for some time.&nbsp; Finding at 
length that no one invited me to be seated, I sat down unasked on the 
nearest chair, never supposing for an instant that the lady of the house 
could be present, and neglect the commonest forms of politeness which 
should be observed towards every stranger.&nbsp; After I had waited for 
some time, Herr von H--- graciously made his appearance, and expressed his 
regret that he should have very little time to spare for me, as he intended
setting sail for Iceland with his family in a short time, and in the 
interim had a number of weighty affairs to settle at Copenhagen; in 
conclusion, he gave me the friendly advice to abandon my intention of 
visiting Iceland, as the fatigues of travelling in that country were very 
great; finding, however, that I persevered in my intention, he promised, in
case I set sail for Reikjavik earlier than himself, to give me a letter of 
recommendation.&nbsp; All this was concluded in great haste, and we stood 
during the interview.&nbsp; I took my leave, and at first determined not to
call again for the letter.&nbsp; On reflection, however, I changed my mind,
ascribed my unfriendly reception to important and perhaps disagreeable 
business, and called again two days afterwards.&nbsp; Then the letter was 
handed to me by a servant; the high people, whom I could hear conversing in
the adjoining apartment, probably considered it too much trouble to deliver
it to me personally.</p>
<p>On paying my respects to this amiable family in Reikjavik, I was not a 
little surprised to recognise in Frau von H--- one of those ladies who in 
Copenhagen had not had the civility to ask me to be seated.&nbsp; Five or 
six days afterwards, Herr von H--- returned my call, and invited me to an 
excursion to Vatne.&nbsp; I accepted the invitation with much pleasure, and
mentally asked pardon of him for having formed too hasty an opinion.&nbsp; 
Frau von H---, however, did not find her way to me until the fourth week of
my stay in Reikjavik; she did not even invite me to visit her again, so of 
course I did not go, and our acquaintance terminated there.&nbsp; As in 
duty bound, the remaining dignitaries of this little town took their tone 
from their chief.&nbsp; My visits were unreturned, and I received no 
invitations, though I heard much during my stay of parties of pleasure, 
dinners, and evening parties.&nbsp; Had I not fortunately been able to 
employ myself, I should have been very badly off.&nbsp; Not one of the 
ladies had kindness and delicacy enough to consider that I was alone here, 
and that the society of educated people might be necessary for my 
comfort.&nbsp; I was less annoyed at the want of politeness in the 
gentlemen; for I am no longer young, and that accounts for every 
thing.&nbsp; When the women were wanting in kindliness, I had no right to 
expect consideration from the gentlemen.</p>
<p>I tried to discover the reason of this treatment, and soon found that it
lay in a national characteristic of these people&mdash;their 
selfishness.</p>
<p>It appears I had scarcely arrived at Reikjavik before diligent inquiries
were set on foot as to whether I was <i>rich</i>, and should see much 
company at my house, and, in fact, whether much could be got out of me.</p>
<p>To be well received here it is necessary either to be rich, or else to 
travel as a naturalist.&nbsp; Persons of the latter class are generally 
sent by the European courts to investigate the remarkable productions of 
the country.&nbsp; They make large collections of minerals, birds, &amp;c.;
they bring with them numerous presents, sometimes of considerable value, 
which they distribute among the dignitaries; they are, moreover, the 
projectors of many an entertainment, and even of many a little ball, 
&amp;c.; they buy up every thing they can procure for their cabinets, and 
they always travel in company; they have much baggage with them, and 
consequently require many horses, which cannot be hired in Iceland, but 
must be bought.&nbsp; On such occasions every one here is a dealer: offers 
of horses and cabinets pour in on all sides.</p>
<p>The most welcome arrival of all is that of the French frigate, which 
visits Iceland every year; for sometimes there are 
<i>d&eacute;je&ucirc;ners &agrave; la fourchette</i> on board, sometimes 
little evening parties and balls.&nbsp; There is at least something to be 
got besides the rich presents; the &ldquo;Stiftsamtmann&rdquo; even 
receives 600 florins per annum from the French government to defray the 
expense of a few return balls which he gives to the naval officers.</p>
<p>With me this was not the case: I gave no parties&mdash;I brought no 
presents&mdash;they had nothing to expect from me; and therefore they left 
me to myself. <a name="citation28"></a><a href="#footnote28" 
class="citation">[28]</a></p>
<p>For this reason I affirm that he only can judge of the character of a 
people who comes among them without claim to their attention, and from whom
they have nothing to expect.&nbsp; To such a person only do they appear in 
their true colours, because they do not find it worth while to dissemble 
and wear a mask in his presence.&nbsp; In these cases the traveller is 
certainly apt to make painful discoveries; but when, on the other hand, he 
meets with good people, he may be certain of their sincerity; and so I must
beg my honoured readers to bear with me, when I mention the names of all 
those who heartily welcomed the undistinguished foreigner; it is the only 
way in which I can express my gratitude towards them.</p>
<p>As I said before, I had intercourse with very few people, so that ample 
time remained for solitary walks, during which I minutely noticed every 
thing around me.</p>
<p>The little town of Reikjavik consists of a single broad street, with 
houses and cottages scattered around.&nbsp; The number of inhabitants does 
not amount to 500.</p>
<p>The houses of the wealthier inhabitants are of wood-work, and contain 
merely a ground-floor, with the exception of a single building of one 
story, to which the high school, now held at Bassast&auml;dt, will be 
transferred next year.&nbsp; The house of the &ldquo;Stiftsamtmann&rdquo; 
is built of stone.&nbsp; It was originally intended for a prison; but as 
criminals are rarely to be met with in Iceland, the building was many years
ago transformed into the residence of the royal officer.&nbsp; A second 
stone building, discernible from Reikjavik, is situated at Langarnes, half 
a mile from the town.&nbsp; It lies near the sea, in the midst of meadows, 
and is the residence of the bishop.</p>
<p>The church is capable of holding only at the most from 100 to 150 
persons; it is built of stone, with a wooden roof.&nbsp; In the chambers of
this roof the library, consisting of several thousand volumes, is 
deposited.&nbsp; The church contains a treasure which many a larger and 
costlier edifice might envy,&mdash;a baptismal font by Thorwaldsen, whose 
parents were of Icelandic extraction.&nbsp; The great sculptor himself was 
born in Denmark, and probably wished, by this present, to do honour to the 
birth-place of his ancestors.</p>
<p>To some of the houses in Reikjavik pieces of garden are attached.&nbsp; 
These gardens are small plots of ground where, with great trouble and 
expense, salad, spinach, parsley, potatoes, and a few varieties of edible 
roots, are cultivated.&nbsp; The beds are separated from each other by 
strips of turf a foot broad, seldom boasting even a few field-flowers.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of Iceland are generally of middle stature, and strongly
built, with light hair, frequently inclining to red, and blue eyes.&nbsp; 
The men are for the most part ugly; the women are better favoured, and 
among the girls I noticed some very sweet faces.&nbsp; To attain the age of
seventy or eighty years is here considered an extraordinary circumstance. 
<a name="citation29"></a><a href="#footnote29" 
class="citation">[29]</a>&nbsp; The peasants have many children, and yet 
few; many are born, but few survive the first year.&nbsp; The mothers do 
not nurse them, and rear them on very bad food.&nbsp; Those who get over 
the first year look healthy enough; but they have strangely red cheeks, 
almost as though they had an eruption.&nbsp; Whether this appearance is to 
be ascribed to the sharp air, to which the delicate skin is not yet 
accustomed, or to the food, I know not.</p>
<p>In some places on the coast, when the violent storms prevent the poor 
fishermen for whole weeks from launching their boats, they live almost 
entirely on dried fishes&rsquo; heads. <a name="citation30"></a><a 
href="#footnote30" class="citation">[30]</a>&nbsp; The fishes themselves 
have been salted down and sold, partly to pay the fishermen&rsquo;s taxes, 
and partly to liquidate debts for the necessaries of the past season, among
which brandy and snuff unfortunately play far too prominent a part.</p>
<p>Another reason why the population does not increase is to be found in 
the numerous catastrophes attending the fisheries during the stormy season 
of the year.&nbsp; The fishermen leave the shore with songs and mirth, for 
a bright sky and a calm sea promise them good fortune.&nbsp; But, alas, 
tempests and snow-storms too often overtake the unfortunate boatmen!&nbsp; 
The sea is lashed into foam, and mighty waves overwhelm boats and fishermen
together, and they perish inevitably.&nbsp; It is seldom that the father of
a family embarks in the same boat with his sons.&nbsp; They divide 
themselves among different parties, in order that, if one boat founder, the
whole family may not be destroyed.</p>
<p>I found the cottages of the peasants at Reikjavik smaller, and in every 
respect worse provided, than those at Havenfiord.&nbsp; This seems, 
however, to be entirely owing to the indolence of the peasants themselves; 
for stones are to be had in abundance, and every man is his own 
builder.&nbsp; The cows and sheep live through the winter in a wretched 
den, built either in the cottage itself or in its immediate 
neighbourhood.&nbsp; The horses pass the whole year under the canopy of 
heaven, and must find their own provender.&nbsp; Occasionally only the 
peasant will shovel away the snow from a little spot, to assist the poor 
animals in searching for the grass or moss concealed beneath.&nbsp; It is 
then left to the horses to finish clearing away the snow with their 
feet.&nbsp; It may easily be imagined that this mode of treatment tends to 
render them very hardy; but the wonder is, how the poor creatures manage to
exist through the winter on such spare diet, and to be strong and fit for 
work late in the spring and in summer.&nbsp; These horses are so entirely 
unused to being fed with oats, that they will refuse them when offered; 
they are not even fond of hay.</p>
<p>As I arrived in Iceland during the early spring, I had an opportunity of
seeing the horses and sheep in their winter garments.&nbsp; The horses 
seemed to be covered, not with hair, but with a thick woolly coat; their 
manes and tails are very long, and of surprising thickness.&nbsp; At the 
end of May or the beginning of June the tail and mane are docked and 
thinned, their woolly coat falls of itself, and they then look smooth 
enough.&nbsp; The sheep have also a very thick coat during the 
winter.&nbsp; It is not the custom to shear them, but at the beginning of 
June the wool is picked off piece by piece with the hand.&nbsp; A sheep 
treated in this way sometimes presents a very comical appearance, being 
perfectly naked on one side, while on the other it is still covered with 
wool.</p>
<p>The horses and cows are considerably smaller than those of our 
country.&nbsp; No one need journey so far north, however, to see stunted 
cattle.&nbsp; Already, in Galicia, the cows and horses of the peasants are 
not a whit larger or stronger than those in Iceland.&nbsp; The Icelandic 
cows are further remarkable only for their peculiarly small horns; the 
sheep are also smaller than ours.</p>
<p>Every peasant keeps horses.&nbsp; The mode of feeding them is, as 
already shewn, very simple; the distances are long, the roads bad, and 
large rivers, moorlands, and swamps must frequently be passed; so every one
rides, both men, women, and children.&nbsp; The use of carriages is as 
totally unknown throughout the island as in Syria.</p>
<p>The immediate vicinity of Reikjavik is pretty enough.&nbsp; Some of the 
townspeople go to much trouble and expense in sometimes collecting and 
sometimes breaking the stones around their dwellings.&nbsp; With the little
ground thus obtained they mix turf, ashes, and manure, until at length a 
soil is formed on which something will grow.&nbsp; But this is such a 
gigantic undertaking, that the little culture bestowed on the spots wholly 
neglected by nature cannot be wondered at.&nbsp; Herr Bernh&ouml;ft shewed 
me a small meadow which he had leased for thirty years, at an annual rent 
of thirty kreutzers.&nbsp; In order, however, to transform the land he 
bought into a meadow, which yields winter fodder for only one cow, it was 
necessary to expend more than 150 florins, besides much personal labour and
pains.&nbsp; The rate of wages for peasants is very high when compared with
the limited wants of these people: they receive thirty or forty kreutzers 
per diem, and during the hay-harvest as much as a florin.</p>
<p>For a long distance round the town the ground consists of stones, turf, 
and swamps.&nbsp; The latter are mostly covered with hundreds upon hundreds
of great and small mounds of firm ground.&nbsp; By jumping from one of 
these mounds to the next, the entire swamp may be crossed, not only without
danger, but dry-footed.</p>
<p>In spite of all this, one of these swamps put me in a position of much 
difficulty and embarrassment during one of my solitary excursions.&nbsp; I 
was sauntering quietly along, when suddenly a little butterfly fluttered 
past me.&nbsp; It was the first I had seen in this country, and my 
eagerness to catch it was proportionately great.&nbsp; I hastened after it;
thought neither of swamp nor of danger, and in the heat of the chase did 
not observe that the mounds became every moment fewer and farther 
between.&nbsp; Soon I found myself in the middle of the swamp, and could 
neither advance nor retreat.&nbsp; Not a human being could I descry; the 
very animals were far from me; and this circumstance confirmed me as to the
dangerous nature of the ground.&nbsp; Nothing remained for me but to fix my
eyes upon one point of the landscape, and to step out boldly towards 
it.&nbsp; I was often obliged to hazard two or three steps into the swamp 
itself, in order to gain the next acclivity, upon which I would then stand 
triumphantly, to determine my farther progress.&nbsp; So long as I could 
distinguish traces of horses&rsquo; hoofs, I had no fear; but even these 
soon disappeared, and I stood there alone in the morass.&nbsp; I could not 
remain for ever on my tower of observation, and had no resource but to take
to the swamp once more.&nbsp; I must confess that I experienced a very 
uncomfortable feeling of apprehension when my foot sank suddenly into the 
soft mud; but when I found that it did not rise higher than the ankles, my 
courage returned; I stepped out boldly, and was fortunate enough to escape 
with the fright and a thorough wetting.</p>
<p>The most arduous posts in the country are those of the medical men and 
clergymen.&nbsp; Their sphere of action is very enlarged, particularly that
of the medical man, whose practice sometimes extends over a distance of 
eighty to a hundred miles.&nbsp; When we add to this the severity of the 
winter, which lasts for seven or eight months, it seems marvellous that any
one can be found to fill such a situation.</p>
<p>In winter the peasants often come with shovels, pickaxes, and horses to 
fetch the doctor.&nbsp; They then go before him, and hastily repair the 
worst part of the road; while the doctor rides sometimes on one horse, 
sometimes on another, that they may not sink under the fatigue.&nbsp; And 
thus the procession travels for many, many miles, through night and fog, 
through storm and snow, for on the doctor&rsquo;s promptitude life and 
death often hang.&nbsp; When he then returns, quite benumbed, and half dead
with cold, to the bosom of his family, in the expectation of rest and 
refreshment, and to rejoice with his friends over the dangers and hardships
he has escaped, the poor doctor is frequently compelled to set off at once 
on a new and important journey, before he has even had time to greet the 
dear ones at home.</p>
<p>Sometimes he is sent for by sea, where the danger is still greater on 
the storm-tost element.</p>
<p>Though the salary of the medical men is not at all proportionate to the 
hardships they are called upon to undergo, it is still far better than that
of the priests.</p>
<p>The smallest livings bring in six to eight florins annually, the richest
200 florins.&nbsp; Besides this, the government supplies for each priest a 
house, often not much better than a peasant&rsquo;s cottage, a few meadows,
and some cattle.&nbsp; The peasants are also required to give certain small
contributions in the way of hay, wool, fish, &amp;c.&nbsp; The greater 
number of priests are so poor, that they and their families dress exactly 
like the peasants, from whom they can scarcely be distinguished.&nbsp; The 
clergyman&rsquo;s wife looks after the cattle, and milks cows and ewes like
a maid-servant; while her husband proceeds to the meadow, and mows the 
grass with the labourer.&nbsp; The intercourse of the pastor is wholly 
confined to the society of peasants; and this constitutes the chief element
of that &ldquo;patriarchal life&rdquo; which so many travellers describe as
charming.&nbsp; I should like to know which of them would wish to lead such
a life!</p>
<p>The poor priest has, besides, frequently to officiate in two, three, or 
even four districts, distant from four to twelve miles from his 
residence.&nbsp; Every Sunday he must do duty at one or other of these 
districts, taking them in turn, so that divine service is only performed at
each place once in every three or four weeks.&nbsp; The journeys of the 
priest, however, are not considered quite so necessary as those of the 
doctor; for if the weather is very bad on Sundays, particularly during the 
winter, he can omit visiting the most distant places.&nbsp; This is done 
the more readily, as but few of the peasants would be at church; all who 
lived at a distance remaining at home.</p>
<p>The Sysselmann (an officer similar to that of the sheriff of a county) 
is the best off.&nbsp; He has a good salary with little to do, and in some 
places enjoys in addition the &ldquo;strand-right,&rdquo; which is at times
no inconsiderable privilege, from the quantity of drift timber washed 
ashore from the American continent.</p>
<p>Fishing and the chase are open to all, with the exception of the 
salmon-fisheries in the rivers; these are farmed by the government.&nbsp; 
Eider-ducks may not be shot, under penalty of a fine.&nbsp; There is no 
military service, for throughout the whole island no soldiers are 
required.&nbsp; Even Reikjavik itself boasts only two police-officers.</p>
<p>Commerce is also free; but the islanders possess so little commercial 
spirit, that even if they had the necessary capital, they would never 
embark in speculation.</p>
<p>The whole commerce of Iceland thus lies in the hands of Danish 
merchants, who send their ships to the island every year, and have 
established factories in the different ports where the retail trade is 
carried on.</p>
<p>These ships bring every thing to Iceland, corn, wood, wines, 
manufactured goods, and colonial produce, &amp;c.&nbsp; The imports are 
free, for it would not pay the government to establish offices, and give 
servants salaries to collect duties upon the small amount of produce 
required for the island.&nbsp; Wine, and in fact all colonial produce, are 
therefore much cheaper than in other countries.</p>
<p>The exports consist of fish, particularly salted cod, fish-roe, tallow, 
train-oil, eider-down, and feathers of other birds, almost equal to 
eider-down in softness, sheep&rsquo;s wool, and pickled or salted 
lamb.&nbsp; With the exception of the articles just enumerated, the 
Icelanders possess nothing; thirteen years ago, when Herr Knudson 
established a bakehouse, <a name="citation31"></a><a href="#footnote31" 
class="citation">[31]</a> he was compelled to bring from Copenhagen, not 
only the builder, but even the materials for building, stones, lime, 
&amp;c.; for although the island abounds with masses of stone, there are 
none which can be used for building an oven, or which can be burnt into 
lime: every thing is of lava.</p>
<p>Two or three cottages situated near each other are here dignified by the
name of a &ldquo;place.&rdquo;&nbsp; These places, as well as the separate 
cottages, are mostly built on little acclivities, surrounded by 
meadows.&nbsp; The meadows are often fenced in with walls of stone or 
earth, two or three feet in height, to prevent the cows, sheep, and horses 
from trespassing upon them to graze.&nbsp; The grass of these meadows is 
made into hay, and laid up as a winter provision for the cows.</p>
<p>I did not hear many complaints of the severity of the cold in winter; 
the temperature seldom sinks to twenty degrees below zero; the sea is 
sometimes frozen, but only a few feet from the shore.&nbsp; The snowstorms 
and tempests, however, are often so violent, that it is almost impossible 
to leave the house.&nbsp; Daylight lasts only for five or six hours, and to
supply its place the poor Icelanders have only the northern light, which is
said to illumine the long nights with a brilliancy truly marvellous.</p>
<p>The summer I passed in Iceland was one of the finest the inhabitants had
known for years.&nbsp; During the month of June the thermometer often rose 
at noon to twenty degrees.&nbsp; The inhabitants found this heat so 
insupportable, that they complained of being unable to work or to go on 
messages during the day-time.&nbsp; On such warm days they would only begin
their hay-making in the evening, and continued their work half the 
night.</p>
<p>The changes in the weather are very remarkable.&nbsp; Twenty degrees of 
heat on one day would be followed by rain on the next, with a temperature 
of only five degrees; and on the 5th of June, at eight o&rsquo;clock in the
morning, the thermometer stood at one degree below zero.&nbsp; It is also 
curious that thunderstorms happen in Iceland in winter, and are said never 
to occur during the summer.</p>
<p>From the 16th or 18th of June to the end of the month there is no 
night.&nbsp; The sun appears only to retire for a short time behind a 
mountain, and forms sunset and morning-dawn at the same time.&nbsp; As on 
one side the last beam fades away, the orb of day re-appears at the 
opposite one with redoubled splendour.</p>
<p>During my stay in Iceland, from the 15th of May to the 29th of July, I 
never retired to rest before eleven o&rsquo;clock at night, and never 
required a candle.&nbsp; In May, and also in the latter portion of the 
month of July, there was twilight for an hour or two, but it never became 
quite dark.&nbsp; Even during the last days of my stay, I could read until 
half-past ten o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; At first it appeared strange to me to go
to bed in broad daylight; but I soon accustomed myself to it, and when 
eleven o&rsquo;clock came, no sunlight was powerful enough to cheat me of 
my sleep.&nbsp; I found much pleasure in walking at night, at past ten 
o&rsquo;clock, not in the pale moonshine, but in the broad blaze of the 
sun.</p>
<p>It was a much more difficult task to accustom myself to the diet.&nbsp; 
The baker&rsquo;s wife was fully competent to superintend the cooking 
according to the Danish and Icelandic schools of the art; but unfortunately
these modes of cookery differ widely from ours.&nbsp; One thing only was 
good, the morning cup of coffee with cream, with which the most 
accomplished gourmand could have found no fault: since my departure from 
Iceland I have not found such coffee.&nbsp; I could have wished for some of
my dear Viennese friends to breakfast with me.&nbsp; The cream was so 
thick, that I at first thought my hostess had misunderstood me, and brought
me curds.&nbsp; The butter made from the milk of Icelandic cows and ewes 
did not look very inviting, and was as white as lard, but the taste was 
good.&nbsp; The Icelanders, however, find the taste not sufficiently 
&ldquo;piquant,&rdquo; and generally qualify it with train-oil.&nbsp; 
Altogether, train-oil plays a very prominent part in the Icelandic kitchen;
the peasant considers it a most delicious article, and thinks nothing of 
devouring a quantity of it without bread, or indeed any thing else. <a 
name="citation32"></a><a href="#footnote32" class="citation">[32]</a></p>
<p>I did not at all relish the diet at dinner; this meal consisted of two 
dishes, namely, boiled fish, with vinegar and melted butter instead of oil,
and boiled potatoes.&nbsp; Unfortunately I am no admirer of fish, and now 
this was my daily food.&nbsp; Ah, how I longed for beef-soup, a piece of 
meat, and vegetables, in vain!&nbsp; As long as I remained in Iceland, I 
was compelled quite to give up my German system of diet.</p>
<p>After a time I got on well enough with the boiled fish and potatoes, but
I could not manage the delicacies of the island.&nbsp; Worthy Madame 
Bernh&ouml;ft, it was so kindly meant on her part; and it was surely not 
her fault that the system of cookery in Iceland is different from ours; but
I could not bring myself to like the Icelandic delicacies.&nbsp; They were 
of different kinds, consisting sometimes of fishes, hard-boiled eggs, and 
potatoes chopped up together, covered with a thick brown sauce, and 
seasoned with pepper, sugar, and vinegar; at others, of potatoes baked in 
butter and sugar.&nbsp; Another delicacy was cabbage chopped very small, 
rendered very thin by the addition of water, and sweetened with sugar; the 
accompanying dish was a piece of cured lamb, which had a very unpleasant 
&ldquo;pickled&rdquo; flavour.</p>
<p>On Sundays we sometimes had &ldquo;Prothe Gr&uuml;tze,&rdquo; properly a
Scandinavian dish, composed of fine sago boiled to a jelly, with 
currant-juice or red wine, and eaten with cream or sugar.&nbsp; Tapfen, a 
kind of soft cheese, is also sometimes eaten with cream and sugar.</p>
<p>In the months of June and July the diet improved materially.&nbsp; We 
could often procure splendid salmon, sometimes roast lamb, and now and then
birds, among which latter dainties the snipes were particularly good.&nbsp;
In the evening came butter, cheese, cold fish, smoked lamb, and eggs of 
eider-ducks, which are coarser than hen&rsquo;s eggs.&nbsp; In time I 
became so accustomed to this kind of food, that I no longer missed either 
soup or beef, and felt uncommonly well.</p>
<p>My drink was always clear fresh water; the gentlemen began their dinner 
with a small glass of brandy, and during the meal all drank beer of Herr 
Bernh&ouml;ft&rsquo;s own brewing, which was very good.&nbsp; On Sundays, a
bottle of port or Bordeaux sometimes made its appearance at our table; and 
as we fared at Herr Bernh&ouml;ft&rsquo;s, so it was the custom in the 
houses of all the merchants and officials.</p>
<p>At Reikjavik I had an opportunity of witnessing a great religious 
ceremony.&nbsp; Three candidates of theology were raised to the ministerial
office.&nbsp; Though the whole community here is Lutheran, the ceremonies 
differ in many respects from those of the continent of Europe, and I will 
therefore give a short sketch of what I saw.&nbsp; The solemnity began at 
noon, and lasted till four o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; I noticed at once that all 
the people covered their faces for a moment on entering the church, the men
with their hats, and the women with their handkerchiefs.&nbsp; Most of the 
congregation sat with their faces turned towards the altar; but this rule 
had its exceptions.&nbsp; The vestments of the priests were the same as 
those worn by our clergymen, and the commencement of the service also 
closely resembled the ritual of our own Church; but soon this resemblance 
ceased.&nbsp; The bishop stepped up to the altar with the candidates, and 
performed certain ceremonies; then one would mount the pulpit and read part
of a sermon, or sing a psalm, while the other clergymen sat round on 
chairs, and appeared to listen; then a second and a third ascended the 
pulpit, and afterwards another sermon was preached from the altar, and 
another psalm sung; then a sermon was again read from the pulpit.&nbsp; 
While ceremonies were performed at the altar, the sacerdotal garments were 
often put on and taken off again.&nbsp; I frequently thought the service 
was coming to a close, but it always began afresh, and lasted, as I said 
before, until four o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; The number of forms surprised me 
greatly, as the ritual of the Lutheran Church is in general exceedingly 
simple.</p>
<p>On this occasion a considerable number of the country people were 
assembled, and I had thus a good opportunity of noticing their 
costumes.&nbsp; The dresses worn by the women and girls are all made of 
coarse black woollen stuffs.&nbsp; The dress consists of a long skirt, a 
spencer, and a coloured apron.&nbsp; On their heads they wear a man&rsquo;s
nightcap of black cloth, the point turned downwards, and terminating in a 
large tassel of wool or silk, which hangs down to the shoulder.&nbsp; Their
hair is unbound, and reaches only to the shoulder: some of the women wear 
it slightly curled.&nbsp; I involuntarily thought of the poetical 
descriptions of the northern romancers, who grow enthusiastic in praise of 
ideal &ldquo;angels&rsquo; heads with golden tresses.&rdquo;&nbsp; The hair
is certainly worn in this manner here, and our poets may have borrowed 
their descriptions from the Scandinavians.&nbsp; But the beautiful faces 
which are said to beam forth from among those golden locks exist only in 
the poet&rsquo;s vivid imagination.</p>
<p>Ornamental additions to the costume are very rare.&nbsp; In the whole 
assembly I only noticed four women who were dressed differently from the 
others.&nbsp; The cords which fastened their spencers, and also their 
girdles, were ornamented with a garland worked in silver thread.&nbsp; 
Their skirts were of fine black cloth, and decorated with a border of 
coloured silk a few inches broad.&nbsp; Round their necks they wore a kind 
of stiff collar of black velvet with a border of silver thread, and on 
their heads a black silk handkerchief with a very strange addition.&nbsp; 
This appendage consisted of a half-moon fastened to the back of the head, 
and extending five or six inches above the forehead.&nbsp; It was covered 
with white lawn arranged in folds; its breadth at the back of the head did 
not exceed an inch and a half, but in front it widened to five or six 
inches.</p>
<p>The men, I found, were clothed almost like our peasants.&nbsp; They wore
small-clothes of dark cloth, jackets and waistcoats, felt hats, or fur 
caps; and instead of boots a kind of shoe of ox-hide, sheep, or seal-skin, 
bound to the feet by a leather strap.&nbsp; The women, and even the 
children of the officials, all wear shoes of this description.</p>
<p>It was very seldom that I met people so wretchedly and poorly clad as we
find them but too often in the large continental towns.&nbsp; I never saw 
any one without good warm shoes and stockings.</p>
<p>The better classes, such as merchants, officials, &amp;c. are dressed in
the French style, and rather fashionably.&nbsp; There is no lack of silk 
and other costly stuffs.&nbsp; Some of these are brought from England, but 
the greater part come from Denmark.</p>
<p>On the king&rsquo;s birthday, which is kept every year at the house of 
the Stiftsamtmann, the festivities are said to be very grand; on this 
occasion the matrons appear arrayed in silk, and the maidens in white 
jaconet; the rooms are lighted with wax tapers.</p>
<p>Some speculative genius or other has also established a sort of club in 
Reikjavik.&nbsp; He has, namely, hired a couple of rooms, where the 
townspeople meet of an evening to discuss &ldquo;tea-water,&rdquo; bread 
and butter, and sometimes even a bottle of wine or a bowl of punch.&nbsp; 
In winter the proprietor gives balls in these apartments, charging 20 kr. 
for each ticket of admission.&nbsp; Here the town grandees and the 
handicraftsmen, in fact all who choose to come, assemble; and the ball is 
said to be conducted in a very republican spirit.&nbsp; The shoemaker leads
forth the wife of the Stiftsamtmann to the dance, while that official 
himself has perhaps chosen the wife or daughter of the shoemaker or baker 
for his partner.&nbsp; The refreshments consist of &ldquo;tea-water&rdquo; 
and bread and butter, and the room is lighted with tallow candles.&nbsp; 
The music, consisting of a kind of three-stringed violin and a pipe, is 
said to be exquisitely horrible.</p>
<p>In summer the dignitaries make frequent excursions on horse-back; and on
these occasions great care is taken that there be no lack of 
provisions.&nbsp; Commonly each person contributes a share: some bring 
wine, others cake; others, again, coffee, and so on.&nbsp; The ladies use 
fine English side-saddles, and wear elegant riding-habits, and pretty felt 
hats with green veils.&nbsp; These jaunts, however, are confined to 
Reikjavik; for, as I have already observed, there is, with the exception of
this town, no place in Iceland containing more than two or three stores and
some half-dozen cottages.</p>
<p>To my great surprise, I found no less than six square piano-fortes 
belonging to different families in Reikjavik, and heard waltzes by our 
favourite composers, besides variations of Herz, and some pieces of Liszt, 
Wilmers, and Thalberg.&nbsp; But such playing!&nbsp; I do not think that 
these talented composers would have recognised their own works.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I must offer a few remarks relative to the travelling in 
this country.</p>
<p>The best time to choose for this purpose is from the middle of June to 
the end of August at latest.&nbsp; Until June the rivers are so swollen and
turbulent, by reason of the melting snows, as to render it very dangerous 
to ride through them.&nbsp; The traveller must also pass over many a field 
of snow not yet melted by the sun, and frequently concealing chasms and 
masses of lava; and this is attended with danger almost as great.&nbsp; At 
every footstep the traveller sinks into the snow; and he may thank his 
lucky stars if the whole rotten surface does not give way.&nbsp; In 
September the violent storms of wind and rain commence, and heavy falls of 
snow may be expected from day to day.</p>
<p>A tent, provisions, cooking utensils, pillows, bed-clothes, and warm 
garments, are highly necessary for the wayfarer&rsquo;s comfort.&nbsp; This
paraphernalia would have been too expensive for me to buy, and I was 
unprovided with any thing of the kind; consequently I was forced to endure 
the most dreadful hardships and toil, and was frequently obliged to ride an
immense distance to reach a little church or a cottage, which would afford 
me shelter for the night.&nbsp; My sole food for eight or ten days together
was often bread and cheese; and I generally passed the night upon a chest 
or a bench, where the cold would often prevent my closing my eyes all 
night.</p>
<p>It is advisable to be provided with a waterproof cloak and a 
sailor&rsquo;s tarpaulin hat, as a defence against the rain, which 
frequently falls.&nbsp; An umbrella would be totally useless, as the rain 
is generally accompanied by a storm, or, at any rate, by a strong wind; 
when we add to this, that it is necessary in some places to ride quickly, 
it will easily be seen that holding an umbrella open is a thing not to be 
thought of.</p>
<p>Altogether I found the travelling in this country attended with far more
hardship than in the East.&nbsp; For my part, I found the dreadful storms 
of wind, the piercing air, the frequent rain, and the cold, much less 
endurable than the Oriental heat, which never gave me either cracked lips 
or caused scales to appear on my face.&nbsp; In Iceland my lips began to 
bleed on the fifth day; and afterwards the skin came off my face in scales,
as if I had had the scrofula.&nbsp; Another source of great discomfort is 
to be found in the long riding-habit.&nbsp; It is requisite to be very 
warmly clad; and the heavy skirts, often dripping with rain, coil 
themselves round the feet of the wearer in such a manner, as to render her 
exceedingly awkward either in mounting or dismounting.&nbsp; The worst 
hardship of all, however, is the being obliged to halt to rest the horses 
in a meadow during the rain.&nbsp; The long skirts suck up the water from 
the damp grass, and the wearer has often literally not a dry stitch in all 
her garments.</p>
<p>Heat and cold appear in this country to affect strangers in a remarkable
degree.&nbsp; The cold seemed to me more piercing, and the heat more 
oppressive in Iceland, than when the thermometer stood at the same points 
in my native land.</p>
<p>In summer the roads are marvellously good, so that one can generally 
ride at a pretty quick pace.&nbsp; They are, however, impracticable for 
vehicles, partly because they are too narrow, and partly also on account of
some very bad places which must occasionally be encountered.&nbsp; On the 
whole island not a single carriage is to be found.</p>
<p>The road is only dangerous when it leads through swamps and moors, or 
over fields of lava.&nbsp; Among these fields, such as are covered with 
white moss are peculiarly to be feared, for the moss frequently conceals 
very dangerous holes, into which the horse can easily stumble.&nbsp; In 
ascending and descending the hills very formidable spots sometimes oppose 
the traveller&rsquo;s progress.&nbsp; The road is at times so hidden among 
swamps and bogs, that not a trace of it is to be distinguished, and I could
only wonder how my guide always succeeded in regaining the right 
path.&nbsp; One could almost suppose that on these dangerous paths both 
horse and man are guided by a kind of instinct.</p>
<p>Travelling is more expensive in Iceland than any where else, 
particularly when one person travels alone, and must bear all the expense 
of the baggage, the guide, ferries, &amp;c.&nbsp; Horses are not let out on
hire, they must be bought.&nbsp; They are, however, very cheap; a 
pack-horse costs from eighteen to twenty-four florins, and a riding-horse 
from forty to fifty florins.&nbsp; To travel with any idea of comfort it is
necessary to have several pack-horses, for they must not be heavily laden; 
and an additional servant must likewise be hired, as the guide only looks 
after the saddle-horses, and, at most, one or two of the pack-horses.&nbsp;
If the traveller, at the conclusion of the journey, wishes to sell the 
horses, such a wretchedly low price is offered, that it is just as well to 
give them away at once.&nbsp; This is a proof of the fact that men are 
every where alike ready to follow up their advantage.&nbsp; These people 
are well aware that the horses must be left behind at any rate, and 
therefore they will not bid for them.&nbsp; I must confess that I found the
character of the Icelanders in every respect below the estimate I had 
previously formed of it, and still further below the standard given in 
books.</p>
<p>In spite of their scanty food, the Icelandic horses have a marvellous 
power of endurance; they can often travel from thirty-five to forty miles 
per diem for several consecutive days.&nbsp; But the only difficulty is to 
keep the horse moving.&nbsp; The Icelanders have a habit of continually 
kicking their heels against the poor beast&rsquo;s sides; and the horse at 
last gets so accustomed to this mode of treatment, that it will hardly go 
if the stimulus be discontinued.&nbsp; In passing the bad pieces of road it
is necessary to keep the bridle tight in hand, or the horse will stumble 
frequently.&nbsp; This and the continual urging forward of the horse render
riding very fatiguing. <a name="citation33"></a><a href="#footnote33" 
class="citation">[33]</a></p>
<p>Not a little consideration is certainly required before undertaking a 
journey into the far north; but nothing frightened me,&mdash;and even in 
the midst of the greatest dangers and hardships I did not for one moment 
regret my undertaking, and would not have relinquished it under any 
consideration.</p>
<p>I made excursions to every part of Iceland, and am thus enabled to place
before my readers, in regular order, the chief curiosities of this 
remarkable country.&nbsp; I will commence with the immediate neighbourhood 
of Reikjavik.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<p style="text-align: right">May 25th.</p>
<p>Stiftsamtmann von H--- was to-day kind enough to pay me a visit, and to 
invite me to join his party for a ride to the great lake Vatne.&nbsp; I 
gladly accepted the invitation, for, according to the description given by 
the Stiftsamtmann, I hoped to behold a very Eden, and rejoiced at the 
prospect of observing the recreations of the higher classes, and at the 
same time gaining many acquisitions in specimens of plants, butterflies, 
and beetles.&nbsp; I resolved also to test the capabilities of the 
Icelandic horses more thoroughly than I had been able to do during my first
ride from Havenfiord to Reikjavik, as I had been obliged on that occasion 
to ride at a foot-pace, on account of my old guide.</p>
<p>The hour of starting was fixed for two o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Accustomed 
as I am to strict punctuality, I was ready long before the appointed time, 
and at two o&rsquo;clock was about to hasten to the place of rendezvous, 
when my hostess informed me I had plenty of time, for Herr von H--- was 
still at dinner.&nbsp; Instead of meeting at two o&rsquo;clock, we did not 
assemble until three, and even then another quarter of an hour elapsed 
before the cavalcade started.&nbsp; Oh, Syrian notions of punctuality and 
dispatch!&nbsp; Here, almost at the very antipodes, did I once more greet 
ye.</p>
<p>The party consisted of the nobility and the town dignitaries.&nbsp; 
Among the former class may be reckoned Stiftsamtmann von H--- and his lady;
a privy councillor, Herr von B---, who had been sent from Copenhagen to 
attend the &ldquo;Allthing&rdquo; (political assembly); and a Danish baron,
who had accompanied the councillor.&nbsp; I noticed among the town 
dignitaries the daughter and wife of the apothecary, and the daughters of 
some merchants resident here.</p>
<p>Our road lay through fields of lava, swamps, and very poor grassy 
patches, in a great valley, swelling here and there into gentle 
acclivities, and shut in on three sides by several rows of mountains, 
towering upwards in the most diversified shapes.&nbsp; In the far distance 
rose several jokuls or glaciers, seeming to look proudly down upon the 
mountains, as though they asked, &ldquo;Why would ye draw men&rsquo;s eyes 
upon you, where we glisten in our silver sheen?&rdquo;&nbsp; In the season 
of the year at which I beheld them, the glaciers were still very beautiful;
not only their summits, but their entire surface, as far as visible, being 
covered with snow.&nbsp; The fourth side of the valley through which we 
travelled was washed by the ocean, which melted as it were into the horizon
in immeasurable distance.&nbsp; The coast was dotted with small bays, 
having the appearance of so many lakes.</p>
<p>As the road was good, we could generally ride forward at a brisk 
pace.&nbsp; Occasionally, however, we met with small tracts on which the 
Icelandic horse could exercise its sagacity and address.&nbsp; My horse was
careful and free from vice; it carried me securely over masses of stone and
chasms in the rocks, but I cannot describe the suffering its trot caused 
me.&nbsp; It is said that riding is most beneficial to those who suffer 
from liver-complaints.&nbsp; This may be the case; but I should suppose 
that any one who rode upon an Icelandic horse, with an Icelandic 
side-saddle, every day for the space of four weeks, would find, at the 
expiration of that time, her liver shaken to a pulp, and no part of it 
remaining.</p>
<p>All the rest of the party had good English saddles, mine alone was of 
Icelandic origin.&nbsp; It consisted of a chair, with a board for the 
back.&nbsp; The rider was obliged to sit crooked upon the horse, and it was
impossible to keep a firm seat.&nbsp; With much difficulty I trotted after 
the others, for my horse would not be induced to break into a gallop.</p>
<p>At length, after a ride of an hour and a half, we reached a 
valley.&nbsp; In the midst of a tolerably green meadow I descried what was,
for Iceland, a farm of considerable dimensions, and not far from this farm 
was a very small lake.&nbsp; I did not dare to ask if this was the 
<i>great</i> lake Vatne, or if this was the delicious prospect I had been 
promised, for my question would have been taken for irony.&nbsp; I could 
not refrain from wonder when Herr von H--- began praising the landscape as 
exquisite, and farther declaring the effect of the lake to be 
bewitching.&nbsp; I was obliged, for politeness&rsquo; sake, to acquiesce, 
and leave them in the supposition that I had never seen a larger lake nor a
finer prospect.</p>
<p>We now made a halt, and the whole party encamped in the meadow.&nbsp; 
While the preparations for a social meal were going on, I proceeded to 
satisfy my curiosity.</p>
<p>The peasant&rsquo;s house first attracted my attention.&nbsp; I found it
to consist of one large chamber, and two of smaller size, besides a 
storeroom and extensive stables, from which I judged that the proprietor 
was rich in cattle.&nbsp; I afterwards learnt that he owned fifty sheep, 
eight cows, and five horses, and was looked upon as one of the richest 
farmers in the neighbourhood.&nbsp; The kitchen was situated at the extreme
end of the building, and was furnished with a chimney that seemed intended 
only as a protection against rain and snow, for the smoke dispersed itself 
throughout the whole kitchen, drying the fish which hung from the ceiling, 
and slowly making its exit through an air-hole.</p>
<p>The large apartment boasted a wooden bookshelf, containing about forty 
volumes.&nbsp; Some of these I turned over, and in spite of my limited 
knowledge of the Danish language, could make out enough to discover that 
they were chiefly on religious subjects.&nbsp; But the farmer seemed also 
to love poetry; among the works of this class in his library, I noticed 
Kleist, M&uuml;ller, and even Homer&rsquo;s <i>Odyssey</i>.&nbsp; I could 
make nothing of the Icelandic books; but on inquiring their contents, I was
told that they all treated of religious matters.</p>
<p>After inspecting these, I walked out into the meadow to search for 
flowers and herbs.&nbsp; Flowers I found but few, as it was not the right 
time of the year for them; my search for herbs was more successful, and I 
even found some wild clover.&nbsp; I saw neither beetles nor butterflies; 
but, to my no small surprise, heard the humming of two wild bees, one of 
which I was fortunate enough to catch, and took home to preserve in spirits
of wine.</p>
<p>On rejoining my party, I found them encamped in the meadow around a 
table, which had in the meantime been spread with butter, cheese, bread, 
cake, roast lamb, raisins and almonds, a few oranges, and wine.&nbsp; 
Neither chairs nor benches were to be had, for even wealthy peasants only 
possess planks nailed to the walls of their rooms; so we all sat down upon 
the grass, and did ample justice to the capital coffee which made the 
commencement of the meal.&nbsp; Laughter and jokes predominated to such an 
extent, that I could have fancied myself among impulsive Italians instead 
of cold Northmen.</p>
<p>There was no lack of wit; but to-day I was unfortunately its butt.&nbsp;
And what was my fault?&mdash;only my stupid modesty.&nbsp; The conversation
was carried on in the Danish language; some members of our party spoke 
French and others German, but I purposely abstained from availing myself of
their acquirements, in order not to disturb the hilarity of the 
conversation.&nbsp; I sat silently among them, and was perfectly contented 
in listening to their merriment.&nbsp; But my behaviour was set down as 
proceeding from stupidity, and I soon gathered from their discourse that 
they were comparing me to the &ldquo;stone guest&rdquo; in Mozart&rsquo;s 
<i>Don Giovanni</i>.&nbsp; If these kind people had only surmised the true 
reason of my keeping silence, they would perhaps have thanked me for doing 
so.</p>
<p>As we sat at our meal, I heard a voice in the farmhouse singing an 
Icelandic song.&nbsp; At a distance it resembled the humming of bees; on a 
nearer approach it sounded monotonous, drawling, and melancholy.</p>
<p>While we were preparing for our departure, the farmer, his wife, and the
servants approached, and shook each of us by the hand.&nbsp; This is the 
usual mode of saluting such <i>high</i> people as we numbered among our 
party.&nbsp; The true national salutation is a hearty kiss.</p>
<p>On my arrival at home the effect of the strong coffee soon began to 
manifest itself.&nbsp; I could not sleep at all, and had thus ample leisure
to make accurate observations as to the length of the day and of the 
twilight.&nbsp; Until eleven o&rsquo;clock at night I could read ordinary 
print in my room.&nbsp; From eleven till one o&rsquo;clock it was dusk, but
never so dark as to prevent my reading in the open air.&nbsp; In my room, 
too, I could distinguish the smallest objects, and even tell the time by my
watch.&nbsp; At one o&rsquo;clock I could again read in my room.</p>
<h3>EXCURSION TO VID&Ouml;E.</h3>
<p>The little island of Vid&ouml;e, four miles distant from Reikjavik, is 
described by most travellers as the chief resort of the eider-duck.&nbsp; I
visited the island on the 8th of June, but was disappointed in my 
expectations.&nbsp; I certainly saw many of these birds on the declivities 
and in the chasms of the rocks, sitting quietly on their nests, but nothing
approaching the thousands I had been led to expect.&nbsp; On the whole, I 
may perhaps have seen from one hundred to a hundred and fifty nests.</p>
<p>The most remarkable circumstance connected with the eider-ducks is their
tameness during the period of incubation.&nbsp; I had always regarded as 
myths the stories told about them in this respect, and should do so still 
had I not convinced myself of the truth of these assertions by laying hands
upon the ducks myself.&nbsp; I could go quite up to them and caress them, 
and even then they would not often leave their nests.&nbsp; Some few birds,
indeed, did so when I wished to touch them; but they did not fly up, but 
contented themselves with coolly walking a few paces away from the nest, 
and there sitting quietly down until I had departed.&nbsp; But those which 
already had live young, beat out boldly with their wings when I approached,
struck at me with their bills, and allowed themselves to be taken up bodily
rather than leave the nest.&nbsp; They are about the size of our ducks; 
their eggs are of a greenish grey, rather larger than hen&rsquo;s eggs, and
taste very well.&nbsp; Altogether they lay about eleven eggs.&nbsp; The 
finest down is that with which they line their nests at first; it is of a 
dark grey colour.&nbsp; The Icelanders take away this down, and the first 
nest of eggs.&nbsp; The poor bird now robs herself once more of a quantity 
of down (which is, however, not of so fine a quality as the first), and 
again lays eggs.&nbsp; For the second time every thing is taken from her; 
and not until she has a third time lined the nest with her down is the 
eider-duck left in peace.&nbsp; The down of the second, and that of the 
third quality especially, are much lighter than that of the first.&nbsp; I 
also was sufficiently cruel to take a few eggs and some down out of several
of the nests. <a name="citation34"></a><a href="#footnote34" 
class="citation">[34]</a></p>
<p>I did not witness the dangerous operation of collecting this down from 
between the clefts of rocks and from unapproachable precipices, where 
people are let down, or to which they are drawn up, by ropes, at peril of 
their lives.&nbsp; There are, however, none of these break-neck places in 
the neighbourhood of Reikjavik.</p>
<h3>SALMON FISHERY.</h3>
<p>I made another excursion to a very short distance (two miles) from 
Reikjavik, in the company of Herr Bernh&ouml;ft and his daughter, to the 
Laxselv (salmon river) to witness the salmon-fishing, which takes place 
every week from the middle of June to the middle of August.&nbsp; It is 
conducted in a very simple manner.&nbsp; The fish come up the river in the 
spawning season; the stream is then dammed up with several walls of stone 
loosely piled to the height of some three feet; and the retreat of the fish
to the sea is thus cut off.&nbsp; When the day arrives on which the salmon 
are to be caught, a net is spread behind each of these walls.&nbsp; Three 
or four such dams are erected at intervals, of from eighty to a hundred 
paces, so that even if the fishes escape one barrier, they are generally 
caught at the next.&nbsp; The water is now made to run off as much as 
possible; the poor salmon dart to and fro, becoming every moment more and 
more aware of the sinking of the water, and crowd to the weirs, cutting 
themselves by contact with the sharp stones of which they are built.&nbsp; 
This is the deepest part of the water; and it is soon so thronged with 
fish, that men, stationed in readiness, can seize them in their hands and 
fling them ashore.</p>
<p>The salmon possess remarkable swiftness and strength.&nbsp; The 
fisherman is obliged to take them quickly by the head and tail, and to 
throw them ashore, when they are immediately caught by other men, who fling
them still farther from the water.&nbsp; If this is not done with great 
quickness and care, many of the fishes escape.&nbsp; It is wonderful how 
these creatures can struggle themselves free, and leap into the air.&nbsp; 
The fishermen are obliged to wear woollen mittens, or they would be quite 
unable to hold the smooth salmon.&nbsp; At every day&rsquo;s fishing, from 
five hundred to a thousand fish are taken, each weighing from five to 
fifteen pounds.&nbsp; On the day when I was present eight hundred were 
killed.&nbsp; This salmon-stream is farmed by a merchant of Reikjavik.</p>
<p>The fishermen receive very liberal pay,&mdash;in fact, one-half of the 
fish taken.&nbsp; And yet they are dissatisfied, and show so little 
gratitude, as seldom to finish their work properly.&nbsp; So, for instance,
they only brought the share of the merchant to the harbour of Reikjavik, 
and were far too lazy to carry the salmon from the boat to the warehouse, a
distance certainly not more than sixty or seventy paces from the 
shore.&nbsp; They sent a message to their employer, bidding him &ldquo;send
some fresh hands, for they were much too tired.&rdquo;&nbsp; Of course, in 
a case like this, all remonstrance is unavailing.</p>
<p>As in the rest of the world, so also in Iceland, every occasion that 
offers is seized upon for a feast or a merry-making.&nbsp; The day on which
I witnessed the salmon-fishing happened to be one of the few fine days that
occur during a summer in Iceland.&nbsp; It was therefore unanimously 
concluded by several merchants, that the day and the salmon-fishing should 
be celebrated by a <i>d&eacute;je&ucirc;ner &agrave; la 
fourchette</i>.&nbsp; Every one contributed something, and a plentiful and 
elegant breakfast was soon arranged, which quite resembled an entertainment
of the kind in our country; this one circumstance excepted, that we were 
obliged to seat ourselves on the ground, by reason of a scarcity of tables 
and benches.&nbsp; Spanish and French wines, as well as cold punch, were 
there in plenty, and the greatest hilarity prevailed.</p>
<p>I made a fourth excursion, but to a very inconsiderable 
distance,&mdash;in fact, only a mile and a half from Reikjavik.&nbsp; It 
was to see a hot and slightly sulphurous spring, which falls into a river 
of cold water.&nbsp; By this lucky meeting of extremes, water can be 
obtained at any temperature, from the boiling almost to the freezing 
point.&nbsp; The townspeople take advantage of this good opportunity in two
ways, for bathing and for washing clothes.&nbsp; The latter is undoubtedly 
the more important purpose of application, and a hut has been erected, in 
order to shield the poor people from wind and rain while they are at 
work.&nbsp; Formerly this hut was furnished with a good door and with 
glazed windows, and the key was kept at an appointed place in the town, 
whence any one might fetch it.&nbsp; But the servants and peasant girls 
were soon too lazy to go for the key; they burst open the lock, and smashed
the windows, so that now the hut has a very ruinous appearance, and affords
but little protection against the weather.&nbsp; How much alike mankind are
every where, and how seldom they do right, except when it gives them no 
trouble, and then, unfortunately, there is not much merit to be ascribed to
them, as their doing right is merely the result of a lucky chance!&nbsp; 
Many people also bring fish and potatoes, which they have only to lay in 
the hot water, and in a short time both are completely cooked.</p>
<p>This spring is but little used for the purpose of bathing; at most 
perhaps by a few children and peasants.&nbsp; Its medicinal virtues, if it 
possesses any, are completely unknown.</p>
<h3>THE SULPHUR-SPRINGS AND SULPHUR-MOUNTAINS OF KRISUVIK.</h3>
<p>The 4th of June was fixed for my departure.&nbsp; I had only to pack up 
some bread and cheese, sugar and coffee, then the horses were saddled, and 
at seven o&rsquo;clock the journey was happily commenced.&nbsp; I was alone
with my guide, who, like the rest of his class, could not be considered as 
a very favourable specimen of humanity.&nbsp; He was very lazy, exceedingly
self-interested, and singularly loath to devote any part of his attention 
either to me or to the horses, preferring to concentrate it upon brandy, an
article which can unfortunately be procured throughout the whole 
country.</p>
<p>I had already seen the district between Reikjavik and Havenfiord at my 
first arrival in Iceland.&nbsp; At the present advanced season of the year 
it wore a less gloomy aspect: strawberry-plants and violets,&mdash;the 
former, however, without blossoms, and the latter inodorous,&mdash;were 
springing up between the blocks of lava, together with beautiful ferns 
eight or ten inches high.&nbsp; In spite of the trifling distance, I 
noticed, as a rule, that vegetation was here more luxuriant than at 
Reikjavik; for at the latter place I had found no strawberry-plants, and 
the violets were not yet in blossom.&nbsp; This difference in the 
vegetation is, I think, to be ascribed to the high walls of lava existing 
in great abundance round Havenfiord; they protect the tender plants and 
ferns from the piercing winds.&nbsp; I noticed that both the grass and the 
plants before mentioned throve capitally in the little hollows formed by 
masses of lava.</p>
<p>A couple of miles beyond Havenfiord I saw the first birch-trees, which, 
however, did not exceed two or three feet in height, also some 
bilberry-plants.&nbsp; A number of little butterflies, all of one colour, 
and, as it seemed to me, of the same species, fluttered among the shrubs 
and plants.</p>
<p>The manifold forms and varied outline of the lava-fields present a 
remarkable and really a marvellous appearance.&nbsp; Short as this journey 
is&mdash;for ten hours are amply sufficient for the trip to 
Krisuvik,&mdash;it presents innumerable features for contemplation.&nbsp; I
could only gaze and wonder.&nbsp; I forgot every thing around me, felt 
neither cold nor storm, and let my horse pick his way as slowly as he 
chose, so that I had once almost become separated from my guide.</p>
<p>One of the most considerable of the streams of lava lay in a spacious 
broad valley.&nbsp; The lava-stream itself, about two miles long, and of a 
considerable breadth, traversing the whole of the plain, seemed to have 
been called into existence by magic, as there was no mountain to be seen in
the neighbourhood from which it could have emerged.&nbsp; It appeared to be
the covering of an immense crater, formed, not of separate stones and 
blocks, but of a single and slightly porous mass of rock ten or twelve feet
thick, broken here and there by clefts about a foot in breadth.</p>
<p>Another, and a still larger valley, many miles in circumference, was 
filled with masses of lava shaped like waves, reminding the beholder of a 
petrified sea.&nbsp; From the midst rose a high black mountain, contrasting
beautifully with the surrounding masses of light-grey lava.&nbsp; At first 
I supposed the lava must have streamed forth from this mountain, but soon 
found that the latter was perfectly smooth on all sides, and terminated in 
a sharp peak.&nbsp; The remaining mountains which shut in the valley were 
also perfectly closed, and I looked in vain for any trace of a crater.</p>
<p>We now reached a small lake, and soon afterwards arrived at a larger 
one, called Kleinfarvatne.&nbsp; Both were hemmed in by mountains, which 
frequently rose abruptly from the waters, leaving no room for the passage 
of the horses.&nbsp; We were obliged sometimes to climb the mountains by 
fearfully dizzy paths; at others to scramble downwards, almost clinging to 
the face of the rock.&nbsp; At some points we were even compelled to 
dismount from our horses, and scramble forward on our hands and 
knees.&nbsp; In a word, these dangerous points, which extended over a space
of about seven miles, were certainly quite as bad as any I had encountered 
in Syria; if any thing, they were even more formidable.</p>
<p>I was, however, assured that I should have no more such places to 
encounter during all my further journeys in Iceland, and this information 
quite reconciled me to the roads in this country.&nbsp; For the rest, the 
path was generally tolerably safe even during this tour, which continually 
led me across fields of lava.</p>
<p>A journey of some eight-and-twenty miles brought us at length into a 
friendly valley; clouds of smoke, both small and great, were soon 
discovered rising from the surrounding heights, and also from the valley 
itself; these were the sulphur-springs and sulphur-mountains.</p>
<p>I could hardly restrain my impatience while we traversed the couple of 
miles which separated us from Krisuvik.&nbsp; A few small lakes were still 
to be crossed; and at length, at six o&rsquo;clock in the evening, we 
reached our destination.</p>
<p>With the exception of a morsel of bread and cheese, I had eaten nothing 
since the morning; still I could not spare time to make coffee, but at once
dismounted, summoned my guide, and commenced my pilgrimage to the smoking 
mountains.&nbsp; At the outset our way lay across swampy places and meadow 
lands; but soon we had to climb the mountains themselves, a task rendered 
extremely difficult by the elastic, yielding soil, in which every footstep 
imprinted itself deeply, suggesting to the traveller the unpleasant 
possibility of his sinking through,&mdash;a contingency rendered any thing 
but agreeable by the neighbourhood of the boiling springs.&nbsp; At length 
I gained the summit, and saw around me numerous basins filled with boiling 
water, while on all sides, from hill and valley, columns of vapour rose out
of numberless clefts in the rocks.&nbsp; From a cleft in one rock in 
particular a mighty column of vapour whirled into the air.&nbsp; On the 
windward side I could approach this place very closely.&nbsp; The ground 
was only lukewarm in some places, and I could hold my hand for several 
moments to the gaps from which steam issued.&nbsp; No trace of a crater was
to be seen.&nbsp; The bubbling and hissing of the steam, added to the noise
of the wind, occasioned such a deafening clamour, that I was very glad to 
feel firmer ground beneath my feet, and to leave the place in haste.&nbsp; 
It really seemed as if the interior of the mountain had been a boiling 
caldron.&nbsp; The prospect from these mountains is very fine.&nbsp; 
Numerous valleys and mountains innumerable offered themselves to my view, 
and I could even discern the isolated black rock past which I had ridden 
five or six hours previously.</p>
<p>I now commenced my descent into the valley; at a few hundred paces the 
bubbling and hissing were already inaudible.&nbsp; I supposed that I had 
seen every thing worthy of notice; but much that was remarkable still 
remained.&nbsp; I particularly noticed a basin some five or six feet in 
diameter, filled with boiling mud.&nbsp; This mud has quite the appearance 
of fine clay dissolved in water; its colour was a light grey.</p>
<p>From another basin, hardly two feet in diameter, a mighty column of 
steam shot continually into the air with so much force and noise that I 
started back half stunned, and could have fancied the vault of heaven would
burst.&nbsp; This basin is situated in a corner of the valley, closely shut
in on three sides by hills.&nbsp; In the neighbourhood many hot springs 
gushed forth; but I saw no columns of water, and my guide assured me that 
such a phenomenon was never witnessed here.</p>
<p>There is more danger in passing these spots than even in traversing the 
mountains.&nbsp; In spite of the greatest precautions, I frequently sank in
above the ankles, and would then draw back with a start, and find my foot 
covered with hot mud.&nbsp; From the place where I had broken through, 
steam and hot mud, or boiling water, rose into the air.</p>
<p>Though my guide, who walked before me, carefully probed the ground with 
his stick, he several times sank through half-way to the knee.&nbsp; These 
men are, however, so much accustomed to contingencies of this kind that 
they take little account of them.&nbsp; My guide would quietly repair to 
the next spring and cleanse his clothes from mud.&nbsp; As I was covered 
with it to above the ankles, I thought it best to follow his example.</p>
<p>For excursions like these it is best to come provided with a few boards,
five or six feet in length, with which to cover the most dangerous 
places.</p>
<p>At nine o&rsquo;clock in the evening, but yet in the full glare of the 
sun, we arrived at Krisuvik.&nbsp; I now took time to look at this place, 
which I found to consist of a small church and a few miserable huts.</p>
<p>I crept into one of these dens; it was so dark that a considerable time 
elapsed before I could distinguish objects, the light was only admitted 
through a very small aperture.&nbsp; I found in this hut a few persons who 
were suffering from the eruption called &ldquo;lepra,&rdquo; a disease but 
too commonly met with in Iceland.&nbsp; Their hands and faces were 
completely covered with this eruption; if it spreads over the whole body 
the patient languishes slowly away, and is lost without remedy.</p>
<p>Churches are in this country not only used for purposes of public 
worship, but also serve as magazines for provisions, clothes, &amp;c., and 
as inns for travellers.&nbsp; I do not suppose that a parallel instance of 
desecration could be met with even among the most uncivilised 
nations.&nbsp; I was assured, indeed, that these abuses were about to be 
remedied.&nbsp; A reform of this kind ought to have been carried out long 
ago; and even now the matter seems to remain an open point; for wherever I 
came the church was placed at my disposal for the night, and every where I 
found a store of fish, tallow, and other equally odoriferous 
substances.</p>
<p>The little chapel at Krisuvik is only twenty-two feet long by ten broad;
on my arrival it was hastily prepared for my reception.&nbsp; Saddles, 
ropes, clothes, hats, and other articles which lay scattered about, were 
hastily flung into a corner; mattresses and some nice soft pillows soon 
appeared, and a very tolerable bed was prepared for me on a large chest in 
which the vestments of the priest, the coverings of the altar, &amp;c., 
were deposited.&nbsp; I would willingly have locked myself in, eaten my 
frugal supper, and afterwards written a few pages of my diary before 
retiring to rest; but this was out of the question.&nbsp; The entire 
population of the village turned out to see me, old and young hastened to 
the church, and stood round in a circle and gazed at me.</p>
<p>Irksome as this curiosity was, I was obliged to endure it patiently, for
I could not have sent these good people away without seriously offending 
them; so I began quietly to unpack my little portmanteau, and proceeded to 
boil my coffee over a spirit-lamp.&nbsp; A whispering consultation 
immediately began; they seemed particularly struck by my mode of preparing 
coffee, and followed every one of my movements with eager eyes.&nbsp; My 
frugal meal dispatched, I resolved to try the patience of my audience, and,
taking out my journal, began to write.&nbsp; For a few minutes they 
remained quiet, then they began to whisper one to another, &ldquo;She 
writes, she writes,&rdquo; and this was repeated numberless times.&nbsp; 
There was no sign of any disposition to depart; I believe I could have sat 
there till doomsday, and failed to tire my audience out.&nbsp; At length, 
after this scene had lasted a full hour, I could stand it no longer, and 
was fain to request my amiable visitors to retire, as I wished to go to 
bed.</p>
<p>My sleep that night was none of the sweetest.&nbsp; A certain feeling of
discomfort always attaches to the fact of sleeping in a church alone, in 
the midst of a grave-yard.&nbsp; Besides this, on the night in question 
such a dreadful storm arose that the wooden walls creaked and groaned as 
though their foundations were giving way.&nbsp; The cold was also rather 
severe, my thermometer inside the church shewing only two degrees above 
zero.&nbsp; I was truly thankful when approaching day brought with it the 
welcome hour of departure.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">June 5th.</p>
<p>The heavy sleepiness and extreme indolence of an Icelandic guide render 
departure before seven o&rsquo;clock in the morning a thing not to be 
thought of.&nbsp; This is, however, of little consequence, as there is no 
night in Iceland at this time of year.</p>
<p>Although the distance was materially increased by returning to Reikjavik
by way of Grundivik and Keblevik, I chose this route in order to pass 
through the wildest of the inhabited tracts in Iceland.</p>
<p>The first stage, from Krisuvik to Grundivik, a distance of twelve to 
fourteen miles, lay through fields of lava, consisting mostly of small 
blocks of stone and fragments, filling the valley so completely that not a 
single green spot remained.&nbsp; I here met with masses of lava which 
presented an appearance of singular beauty.&nbsp; They were black mounds, 
ten or twelve feet in height, piled upon each other in the most varied 
forms, their bases covered with a broad band of whitish-coloured moss, 
while the tops were broken into peaks and cones of the most fantastic 
shapes.&nbsp; These lava-streams seem to date from a recent period, as the 
masses are somewhat scaly and glazed.</p>
<p>Grundivik, a little village of a few wretched cottages, lies like an 
oasis in this desert of lava.</p>
<p>My guide wished to remain here, asserting that there was no place 
between this and Keblevik where I could pass the night, and that it would 
be impossible for our horses, exhausted as they were with yesterday&rsquo;s
march, to carry us to Keblevik that night.&nbsp; The true reason of this 
suggestion was that he wished to prolong the journey for another day.</p>
<p>Luckily I had a good map with me, and by dint of consulting it could 
calculate distances with tolerable accuracy; it was also my custom before 
starting on a journey to make particular inquiries as to how I should 
arrange the daily stages.</p>
<p>So I insisted upon proceeding at once; and soon we were wending our way 
through fields of lava towards Stad, a small village six or seven miles 
distant from Grundivik.</p>
<p>On the way I noticed a mountain of most singular appearance.&nbsp; In 
colour it closely resembled iron; its sides were perfectly smooth and 
shining, and streaks of the colour of yellow ochre traversed it here and 
there.</p>
<p>Stad is the residence of a priest.&nbsp; Contrary to the assertions of 
my guide, I found this place far more cheerful and habitable than 
Grundivik.&nbsp; Whilst our horses were resting, the priest paid me a 
visit, and conducted me, not, as I anticipated, into his house, but into 
the church.&nbsp; Chairs and stools were quickly brought there, and my host
introduced his wife and children to me, after which we partook of coffee, 
bread and cheese, &amp;c.&nbsp; On the rail surrounding the altar hung the 
clothes of the priest and his family, differing little in texture and make 
from those of the peasants.</p>
<p>The priest appeared to be a very intelligent, well-read man.&nbsp; I 
could speak the Danish language pretty fluently, and was therefore able to 
converse with him on various subjects.&nbsp; On hearing that I had already 
been in Palestine, he put a number of questions to me, from which I could 
plainly see that he was alike well acquainted with geography, history, 
natural science, &amp;c.&nbsp; He accompanied me several miles on my road, 
and we chatted away the time very pleasantly.</p>
<p>The distance between Krisuvik and Keblevik is about forty-two 
miles.&nbsp; The road lies through a most dreary landscape, among vast 
desert plains, frequently twenty-five to thirty miles in circumference, 
entirely divested of all traces of vegetation, and covered throughout their
extreme area by masses of lava&mdash;gloomy monuments of volcanic 
agency.&nbsp; And yet here, at the very heart of the subterranean fire, I 
saw only a single mountain, the summit of which had fallen in, and 
presented the appearance of a crater.&nbsp; The rest were all completely 
closed, terminating sometimes in a beautiful round top, and sometimes in 
sharp peaks; in other instances they formed long narrow chains.</p>
<p>Who can tell whence these all-destroying masses of lava have poured 
forth, or how many hundred years they have lain in these petrified 
valleys?</p>
<p>Keblevik lies on the sea-coast; but the harbour is insecure, so that 
ships remain here at anchor only so long as is absolutely necessary; there 
are frequently only two or three ships in the harbour.</p>
<p>A few wooden houses, two of which belong to Herr Knudson, and some 
peasants&rsquo; cottages, are the only buildings in this little 
village.&nbsp; I was hospitably received, and rested from the toils of the 
day at the house of Herr Siverson, Herr Knudson&rsquo;s manager.</p>
<p>On the following day (June 6th) I had a long ride to Reikjavik, 
thirty-six good miles, mostly through fields of lava.</p>
<p>The whole tract of country from Grundivik almost to Havenfiord is called
&ldquo;The lava-fields of Reikianes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tired and almost benumbed with cold, I arrived in the evening at 
Reikjavik, with no other wish than to retire to rest as fast as 
possible.</p>
<p>In these three days I had ridden 114 miles, besides enduring much from 
cold, storms, and rain.&nbsp; To my great surprise, the roads had generally
been good; there were, however, many places highly dangerous and 
difficult.</p>
<p>But what mattered these fatigues, forgotten, as they were, after a 
single night&rsquo;s rest? what were they in comparison to the unutterably 
beautiful and marvellous phenomena of the north, which will remain ever 
present to my imagination so long as memory shall be spared me?</p>
<p>The distances of this excursion were: From Reikjavik to Krisuvik, 37 
miles; from Krisuvik to Keblevik, 39 miles; from Keblevik to Reikjavik, 38 
miles: total, 114 miles.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<p>As the weather continued fine, I wished to lose no time in continuing my
wanderings.&nbsp; I had next to make a tour of some 560 miles; it was 
therefore necessary that I should take an extra horse, partly that it might
carry my few packages, consisting of a pillow, some rye-bread, cheese, 
coffee, and sugar, but chiefly that I might be enabled to change horses 
every day, as one horse would not have been equal to the fatigue of so long
a journey.</p>
<p>My former guide could not accompany me on my present journey, as he was 
unacquainted with most of the roads.&nbsp; My kind protectors, Herr Knudson
and Herr Bernh&ouml;ft, were obliging enough to provide another guide for 
me; a difficult task, as it is a rare occurrence to find an Icelander who 
understands the Danish language, and who happens to be sober when his 
services are required.&nbsp; At length a peasant was found who suited our 
purpose; but he considered two florins per diem too little pay, so I was 
obliged to give an additional zwanziger.&nbsp; On the other hand, it was 
arranged that the guide should also take two horses, in order that he might
change every day.</p>
<p>The 16th of June was fixed for the commencement of our journey.&nbsp; 
From the very first day my guide did not shew himself in an amiable point 
of view.&nbsp; On the morning of our departure his saddle had to be patched
together, and instead of coming with two horses, he appeared with only 
one.&nbsp; He certainly promised to buy a second when we should have 
proceeded some miles, adding that it would be cheaper to buy one at a 
little distance from the &ldquo;capital.&rdquo;&nbsp; I at once suspected 
this was merely an excuse of the guide&rsquo;s, and that he wished thereby 
to avoid having the care of four horses.&nbsp; The event proved I was 
right; not a single horse could be found that suited, and so my poor little
animal had to carry the guide&rsquo;s baggage in addition to my own.</p>
<p>Loading the pack-horses is a business of some difficulty, and is 
conducted in the following manner: sundry large pieces of dried turf are 
laid upon the horse&rsquo;s back, but not fastened; over these is buckled a
round piece of wood, furnished with two or three pegs.&nbsp; To these pegs 
the chests and packages are suspended.&nbsp; If the weight is not quite 
equally balanced, it is necessary to stop and repack frequently, for the 
whole load at once gets askew.</p>
<p>The trunks used in this country are massively constructed of wood, 
covered with a rough hide, and strengthened on all sides with nails, as 
though they were intended to last an eternity.&nbsp; The poor horses have a
considerable weight to bear in empty boxes alone, so that very little real 
luggage can be taken.&nbsp; The weight which a horse has to carry during a 
long journey should never exceed 150lbs.</p>
<p>It is impossible to remember how many times our baggage had to be 
repacked during a day&rsquo;s journey.&nbsp; The great pieces of turf would
never stay in their places, and every moment something was wrong.&nbsp; 
Nothing less than a miracle, however, can prevail on an Icelander to depart
from his regular routine.&nbsp; His ancestors packed in such and such a 
manner, and so he must pack also. <a name="citation35"></a><a 
href="#footnote35" class="citation">[35]</a></p>
<p>We had a journey of above forty miles before us the first day, and yet, 
on account of the damaged saddle, we could not start before eight 
o&rsquo;clock in the morning.</p>
<p>The first twelve or fourteen miles of our journey lay through the great 
valley in which Reikjavik is situated; the valley contains many low hills, 
some of which we had to climb.&nbsp; Several rivers, chief among which was 
the Laxselv, opposed our progress, but at this season of the year they 
could be crossed on horseback without danger.&nbsp; Nearly all the valleys 
through which we passed to-day were covered with lava, but nevertheless 
offered many beautiful spots.</p>
<p>Many of the hills we passed seemed to me to be extinct volcanoes; the 
whole upper portion was covered with colossal slabs of lava, as though the 
crater had been choked up with them.&nbsp; Lava of the same description and
colour, but in smaller pieces, lay strewed around.</p>
<p>For the first twelve or fourteen miles the sea is visible from the brow 
of every successive hill.&nbsp; The country is also pretty generally 
inhabited; but afterwards a distance of nearly thirty miles is passed, on 
which there is not a human habitation.&nbsp; The traveller journeys from 
one valley into another, and in the midst of these hill-girt deserts sees a
single small hut, erected for the convenience of those who, in the winter, 
cannot accomplish the long distance in one day, and must take up their 
quarters for the night in the valley.&nbsp; No one must, however, rashly 
hope to find here a human being in the shape of a host.&nbsp; The little 
house is quite uninhabited, and consists only of a single apartment with 
four naked walls.&nbsp; The visitor must depend on the accommodation he 
carries with him.</p>
<p>The plains through which we travelled to-day were covered throughout 
with one and the same kind of lava.&nbsp; It occurs in masses, and also in 
smaller stones, is not very porous, of a light grey colour, and mixed, in 
many instances, with sand or earth.</p>
<p>Some miles from Thingvalla we entered a valley, the soil of which is 
fine, but nevertheless only sparingly covered with grass, and full of 
little acclivities, mostly clothed with delicate moss.&nbsp; I have no 
doubt that the indolence of the inhabitants alone prevents them from 
materially improving many a piece of ground.&nbsp; The worst soil is that 
in the neighbourhood of Reikjavik; yet there we see many a garden, and many
a piece of meadow-land, wrung, as it were, from the barren earth by labour 
and pains.&nbsp; Why should not the same thing be done here&mdash;the more 
so as nature has already accomplished the preliminary work?</p>
<p>Thingvalla, our resting-place for to-night, is situate on a lake of the 
same name, and only becomes visible when the traveller is close upon 
it.&nbsp; The lake is rather considerable, being almost three miles in 
length, and at some parts certainly more than two miles in breadth; it 
contains two small islands,&mdash;Sandey and Nesey.</p>
<p>My whole attention was still riveted by the lake and its naked and 
gloomy circle of mountains, when suddenly, as if by magic, I found myself 
standing on the brink of a chasm, into which I could scarcely look without 
a shudder; involuntarily I thought of Weber&rsquo;s <i>Freysch&uuml;tz</i> 
and the &ldquo;Wolf&rsquo;s Hollow.&rdquo; <a name="citation36"></a><a 
href="#footnote36" class="citation">[36]</a></p>
<p>The scene is the more startling from the circumstance that the traveller
approaching Thingvalla in a certain direction sees only the plains beyond 
this chasm, and has no idea of its existence.&nbsp; It was a fissure some 
five or six fathoms broad, but several hundred feet in depth; and we were 
forced to descend by a small, steep, dangerous path, across large fragments
of lava.&nbsp; Colossal blocks of stone, threatening the unhappy wanderer 
with death and destruction, hang loosely, in the form of pyramids and of 
broken columns, from the lofty walls of lava, which encircle the whole long
ravine in the form of a gallery.&nbsp; Speechless, and in anxious suspense,
we descend a part of this chasm, hardly daring to look up, much less to 
give utterance to a single sound, lest the vibration should bring down one 
of these avalanches of stone, to the terrific force of which the rocky 
fragments scattered around bear ample testimony.&nbsp; The distinctness 
with which echo repeats the softest sound and the lightest footfall is 
truly wonderful.</p>
<p>The appearance presented by the horses, which are allowed to come down 
the ravine after their masters have descended, is most peculiar.&nbsp; One 
could fancy they were clinging to the walls of rock.</p>
<p>This ravine is known by the name of Almanagiau.&nbsp; Its entire length 
is about a mile, but a small portion only can be traversed; the rest is 
blocked up by masses of lava heaped one upon the other.&nbsp; On the right 
hand, the rocky wall opens, and forms an outlet, over formidable masses of 
lava, into the beautiful valley of Thingvalla.&nbsp; I could have fancied I
wandered through the depths of a crater, which had piled around itself 
these stupendous barriers during a mighty eruption in times long gone 
by.</p>
<p>The valley of Thingvalla is considered one of the most beautiful in 
Iceland.&nbsp; It contains many meadows, forming, as it were, a place of 
refuge for the inhabitants, and enabling them to keep many head of 
cattle.&nbsp; The Icelanders consider this little green valley the finest 
spot in the world.&nbsp; Not far from the opening of the ravine, on the 
farther bank of the river Oxer, lies the little village of Thingvalla, 
consisting of three or four cottages and a small chapel.&nbsp; A few 
scattered farms and cottages are situated in the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Thingvalla was once one of the most important places in Iceland; the 
stranger is still shewn the meadow, not far from the village, on which the 
Allthing (general assembly) was held annually in the open air.&nbsp; Here 
the people and their leaders met, pitching their tents after the manner of 
nomads.&nbsp; Here it was also that many an opinion and many a decree were 
enforced by the weight of steel.</p>
<p>The chiefs appeared, ostensibly for peace, at the head of their tribe; 
yet many of them returned not again, but beneath the sword-stroke of their 
enemies obtained that peace which no man seeketh, but which all men 
find.</p>
<p>On one side the valley is skirted by the lake, on the other it is 
bounded by lofty mountains, some of them still partly covered with 
snow.&nbsp; Not far from the entrance of the ravine, the river Oxer rushes 
over a wall of rock of considerable height, forming a beautiful 
waterfall.</p>
<p>It was still fine clear daylight when I reached Thingvalla, and the sky 
rose pure and cloudless over the far distance.&nbsp; It seemed therefore 
the more singular to me to see a few clouds skimming over the surface of 
the mountains, now shrouding a part of them in vapour, now wreathing 
themselves round their summits, now vanishing entirely, to reappear again 
at a different point.</p>
<p>This is a phenomenon frequently observed in Iceland during the finest 
days, and one I had often noticed in the neighbourhood of Reikjavik.&nbsp; 
Under a clear and cloudless sky, a light mist would appear on the brow of a
mountain,&mdash;in a moment it would increase to a large cloud, and after 
remaining stationary for a time, it frequently vanished suddenly, or soared
slowly away.&nbsp; However often it may be repeated, this appearance cannot
fail to interest the observer.</p>
<p>Herr Beck, the clergyman at Thingvalla, offered me the shelter of his 
hut for the night; as the building, however, did not look much more 
promising than the peasants&rsquo; cottages by which it was surrounded, I 
preferred quartering myself in the church, permission to do so being but 
too easily obtained on all occasions.&nbsp; This chapel is not much larger 
than that at Krisuvik, and stands at some distance from the few surrounding
cottages.&nbsp; This was perhaps the reason why I was not incommoded by 
visitors.&nbsp; I had already conquered any superstitious fears derived 
from the proximity of my silent neighbours in the churchyard, and passed 
the night quietly on one of the wooden chests of which I found several 
scattered about.&nbsp; Habit is certainly every thing; after a few nights 
of gloomy solitude one thinks no more about the matter.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">June 17th.</p>
<p>Our journey of to-day was more formidable than that of yesterday.&nbsp; 
I was assured that Reikholt (also called Reikiadal) was almost fifty miles 
distant.&nbsp; Distances cannot always be accurately measured by the map; 
impassable barriers, only to be avoided by circuitous routes, often oppose 
the traveller&rsquo;s progress.&nbsp; This was the case with us 
to-day.&nbsp; To judge from the map, the distance from Thingvalla to 
Reikholt seemed less by a great deal than that from Reikjavik to 
Thingvalla, and yet we were full fourteen hours accomplishing it&mdash;two 
hours longer than on our yesterday&rsquo;s journey.</p>
<p>So long as our way lay through the valley of Thingvalla there was no 
lack of variety.&nbsp; At one time there was an arm of the river Oxer to 
cross, at another we traversed a cheerful meadow; sometimes we even passed 
through little shrubberies,&mdash;that is to say, according to the 
Icelandic acceptation of the term.&nbsp; In my country these lovely 
shrubberies would have been cleared away as useless underwood.&nbsp; The 
trees trail along the ground, seldom attaining a height of more than two 
feet.&nbsp; When one of these puny stems reaches four feet in height, it is
considered a gigantic tree.&nbsp; The greater portion of these miniature 
forests grow on the lava with which the valley is covered.</p>
<p>The formation of the lava here assumes a new character.&nbsp; Up to this
point it has mostly appeared either in large masses or in streams lying in 
strata one above the other; but here the lava covered the greater portion 
of the ground in the form of immense flat slabs or blocks of rock, often 
split in a vertical direction.&nbsp; I saw long fissures of eight or ten 
feet in breadth, and from ten to fifteen feet in depth.&nbsp; In these 
clefts the flowers blossom earlier, and the fern grows taller and more 
luxuriantly, than in the boisterous upper world.</p>
<p>After the valley of Thingvalla has been passed the journey becomes very 
monotonous.&nbsp; The district beyond is wholly uninhabited, and we 
travelled many miles without seeing a single cottage.&nbsp; From one desert
valley we passed into another; all were alike covered with light-grey or 
yellowish lava, and at intervals also with fine sand, in which the horses 
sunk deeply at every step.&nbsp; The mountains surrounding these valleys 
were none of the highest, and it was seldom that a jokul or glacier shone 
forth from among them.&nbsp; The mountains had a certain polished 
appearance, their sides being perfectly smooth and shining.&nbsp; In some 
instances, however, masses of lava formed beautiful groups, bearing a great
resemblance to ruins of ancient buildings, and standing out in peculiarly 
fine relief from the smooth walls.</p>
<p>These mountains are of different colours; they are black or brown, grey 
or yellow, &amp;c.; and the different shades of these colours are displayed
with marvellous effect in the brilliant sunshine.</p>
<p>Nine hours of uninterrupted riding brought us into a large tract of 
moorland, very scantily covered with moss.&nbsp; Yet this was the first and
only grazing-place to be met with in all the long distance from 
Thingvalla.&nbsp; We therefore made a halt of two hours, to let our poor 
horses pick a scanty meal.&nbsp; Large swarms of minute gnats, which seemed
to fly into our eyes, nose, and mouth, annoyed us dreadfully during our 
stay in this place.</p>
<p>On this moor there was also a small lake; and here I saw for the first 
time a small flock of swans.&nbsp; Unfortunately these creatures are so 
very timid, that the most cautious approach of a human being causes them to
rise with the speed of lightning into the air.&nbsp; I was therefore 
obliged perforce to be content with a distant view of these proud 
birds.&nbsp; They always keep in pairs, and the largest flock I saw did not
consist of more than four such pairs.</p>
<p>Since my first arrival in Iceland I had considered the inhabitants an 
indolent race of people; to-day I was strengthened in my opinion by the 
following slight circumstance.&nbsp; The moorland on which we halted to 
rest was separated from the adjoining fields of lava by a narrow ditch 
filled with water.&nbsp; Across this ditch a few stones and slabs had been 
laid, to form a kind of bridge.&nbsp; Now this bridge was so full of holes 
that the horses could not tell where to plant their feet, and refused 
obstinately to cross it, so that in the end we were obliged to dismount and
lead them across.&nbsp; We had scarcely passed this place, and sat down to 
rest, when a caravan of fifteen horses, laden with planks, dried fish, 
&amp;c. arrived at the bridge.&nbsp; Of course the poor creatures observed 
the dangerous ground, and could only be driven by hard blows to 
advance.&nbsp; Hardly twenty paces off there were stones in abundance; but 
rather than devote a few minutes to filling up the holes, these lazy people
beat their horses cruelly, and exposed them to the risk of breaking their 
legs.&nbsp; I pitied the poor animals, which would be compelled to recross 
the bridge, so heartily, that, after they are gone, I devoted a part of my 
resting-time to collecting stones and filling up the holes,&mdash;a 
business which scarcely occupied me a quarter of an hour.</p>
<p>It is interesting to notice how the horses know by instinct the 
dangerous spots in the stony wastes, and in the moors and swamps.&nbsp; On 
approaching these places they bend their heads towards the earth, and look 
sharply round on all sides.&nbsp; If they cannot discover a firm 
resting-place for the feet, they stop at once, and cannot be urged forward 
without many blows.</p>
<p>After a halt of two hours we continued our journey, which again led us 
across fields of lava.&nbsp; At past nine o&rsquo;clock in the evening we 
reached an elevated plain, after traversing which for half an hour we saw 
stretched at our feet the valley of Reikholt or Reikiadal; it is fourteen 
to seventeen miles long, of a good breadth, and girt round by a row of 
mountains, among which several jokuls sparkle in their icy garments.</p>
<p>A sunset seen in the sublime wildness of Icelandic scenery has a 
peculiarly beautiful effect.&nbsp; Over these vast plains, divested of 
trees or shrubs, covered with dark lava, and shut in by mountains almost of
a sable hue, the parting sun sheds an almost magical radiance.&nbsp; The 
peaks of the mountains shine in the bright parting rays, the jokuls are 
shrouded in the most delicate roseate hue, while the lower parts of the 
mountains lie in deep shadow, and frown darkly on the valleys, which 
resemble a sheet of dark blue water, with an atmosphere of a bluish-red 
colour floating above it.&nbsp; The most impressive feature of all is the 
profound silence and solitude; not a sound can be heard, not a living 
creature is to be seen; every thing appears dead.&nbsp; Throughout the 
broad valleys not a town nor a village, no, not even a solitary house or a 
tree or shrub, varies the prospect.&nbsp; The eye wanders over the vast 
desert, and finds not one familiar object on which it can rest.</p>
<p>To-night, as at past eleven o&rsquo;clock we reached the elevated plain,
I saw a sunset which I shall never forget.&nbsp; The sun disappeared behind
the mountains, and in its stead a gorgeous ruddy gleam lighted up hill and 
valley and glacier.&nbsp; It was long ere I could turn away my eyes from 
the glittering heights, and yet the valley also offered much that was 
striking and beautiful.</p>
<p>Throughout almost its entire length this valley formed a meadow, from 
the extremities of which columns of smoke and boiling springs burst 
forth.&nbsp; The mists had almost evaporated, and the atmosphere was bright
and clear, more transparent even than I had seen it in any other 
country.&nbsp; I now for the first time noticed, that in the valley itself 
the radiance was almost as clear as the light of day, so that the most 
minute objects could be plainly distinguished.&nbsp; This was, however, 
extremely necessary, for steep and dangerous paths lead over masses of lava
into the valley.&nbsp; On one side ran a little river, forming many 
picturesque waterfalls, some of them above thirty feet in height.</p>
<p>I strained my eyes in vain to discover any where, in this great valley, 
a little church, which, if it only offered me a hard bench for a couch, 
would at any rate afford me a shelter from the sharp night-wind; for it is 
really no joke to ride for fifteen hours, with nothing to eat but bread and
cheese, and then not even to have the pleasant prospect of a hotel 
<i>&agrave; la villa de Londres</i> or <i>de Paris</i>.&nbsp; Alas, my 
wishes were far more modest.&nbsp; I expected no porter at the gate to give
the signal of my arrival, no waiter, and no chambermaid; I only desired a 
little spot in the neighbourhood of the dear departed Icelanders.&nbsp; I 
was suddenly recalled from these happy delusions by the voice of the guide,
who cried out: &ldquo;Here we are at our destination for 
to-night.&rdquo;&nbsp; I looked joyfully round; alas! I could only see a 
few of those cottages which are never observed until you almost hit your 
nose against one of them, as the grass-covered walls can hardly be 
distinguished from the surrounding meadow.</p>
<p>It was already midnight.&nbsp; We stopped, and turned our horses loose, 
to seek supper and rest in the nearest meadow.&nbsp; Our lot was a less 
fortunate one.&nbsp; The inhabitants were already buried in deep slumbers, 
from which even the barking set up by the dogs at our approach failed to 
arouse them.&nbsp; A cup of coffee would certainly have been very 
acceptable to me; yet I was loath to rouse any one merely for this.&nbsp; A
piece of bread satisfied my hunger, and a draught of water from the nearest
spring tasted most deliciously with it.&nbsp; After concluding my frugal 
meal, I sought out a corner beside a cottage, where I was partially 
sheltered from the too-familiar wind; and wrapping my cloak around me, lay 
down on the ground, having wished myself, with all my heart, a good 
night&rsquo;s rest and pleasant dreams, in the broad daylight, <a 
name="citation37"></a><a href="#footnote37" class="citation">[37]</a> under
the canopy of heaven.&nbsp; Just dropping off to sleep, I was surprised by 
a mild rain, which, of course, at once put to flight every idea of 
repose.&nbsp; Thus, after all, I was obliged to wake some one up, to obtain
the shelter of a roof.</p>
<p>The best room, <i>i.e.</i> the store-room, was thrown open for my 
accommodation, and a small wooden bedstead placed at my disposal.&nbsp; 
Chambers of this kind are luckily found wherever two or three cottages lie 
contiguous to each other; they are certainly far from inviting, as dried 
fish, train-oil, tallow, and many other articles of the same description 
combine to produce a most unsavoury atmosphere.&nbsp; Yet they are 
infinitely preferable to the dwellings of the peasants, which, by the by, 
are the most filthy dens that can be imagined.&nbsp; Besides being redolent
of every description of bad odour, these cottages are infested with vermin 
to a degree which can certainly not be surpassed, except in the dwellings 
of the Greenlanders and Laplanders.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">June 18th.</p>
<p>Yesterday we had been forced to put upon our poor horses a wearisome 
distance of more than fifty miles, as the last forty miles led us through 
desert and uninhabited places, boasting not even a single cottage.&nbsp; 
To-day, however, our steeds had a light duty to perform, for we only 
proceeded seven miles to the little village of Reikiadal, where I halted 
to-day, in order to visit the celebrated springs.</p>
<p>The inconsiderable village called Reikiadal, consisting only of a church
and a few cottages, is situated amidst pleasant meadows.&nbsp; Altogether 
this valley is rich in beautiful meadow-lands; consequently one sees many 
scattered homesteads and cottages, with fine herds of sheep, and a 
tolerable number of horses; cows are less plentiful.</p>
<p>The church at Reikiadal is among the neatest and most roomy of those 
which came under my observation.&nbsp; The dwelling of the priest too, 
though only a turf-covered cottage, is large enough for the comfort of the 
occupants.&nbsp; This parish extends over a considerable area, and is not 
thinly inhabited.</p>
<p>My first care on my arrival was to beg the clergyman, Herr Jonas 
Jonason, to procure for me, as expeditiously as possible, fresh horses and 
a guide, in order that I might visit the springs.&nbsp; He promised to 
provide me with both within half an hour; and yet it was not until three 
hours had been wasted, that, with infinite pains, I saw my wish 
fulfilled.&nbsp; Throughout my stay in Iceland, nothing annoyed me more 
than the slowness and unconcern displayed by the inhabitants in all their 
undertakings.&nbsp; Every wish and every request occupies a long time in 
its fulfilment.&nbsp; Had I not been continually at the good pastor&rsquo;s
side, I believe I should scarcely have attained my object.&nbsp; At length 
every thing was ready, and the pastor himself was kind enough to be my 
guide.</p>
<p>We rode about four miles through this beautiful vale, and in this short 
distance were compelled at least six times to cross the river Sidumule, 
which rolls its most tortuous course through the entire valley.&nbsp; At 
length the first spring was reached; it emerges from a rock about six feet 
in height, standing in the midst of a moor.&nbsp; The upper cavity of the 
natural reservoir, in which the water continually boils and seethes, is 
between two and three feet in diameter.&nbsp; This spring never stops; the 
jet of water rises two, and sometimes even four feet high, and is about 
eighteen inches thick.&nbsp; It is possible to increase the volume of the 
jet for a few seconds, by throwing large stones or lumps of earth into the 
opening, and thus stirring up the spring.&nbsp; The stones are cast 
forcibly forth, and the lumps of earth, dissolved by the action of the 
water, impart to the latter a dingy colour.</p>
<p>Whoever has seen the jet of water at Carlsbad, in Bohemia, can well 
imagine the appearance of this spring, which closely resembles that of 
Carlsbad. <a name="citation38"></a><a href="#footnote38" 
class="citation">[38]</a></p>
<p>In the immediate neighbourhood of the spring is an abyss, in which water
is continually seething, but never rises into the air.&nbsp; At a little 
distance, on a high rock, rising out of the river Sidumule, not far from 
the shore, are other springs.&nbsp; They are three in number, each at a 
short distance from the next, and occupy nearly the entire upper surface of
the rock.&nbsp; Lower down we find a reservoir of boiling water; and at the
foot of the rock, and on the nearest shore, are many more hot springs; but 
most of these are inconsiderable.&nbsp; Many of these hot springs emerge 
almost from the cold river itself.</p>
<p>The chief group, however, lies still farther off, on a rock which may be
about twenty feet in height, and fifty in length.&nbsp; It is called Tunga 
Huer, and rises from the midst of a moor.&nbsp; On this rock there are no 
less than sixteen springs, some emerging from its base, others rather above
the middle, but none from the top of the rock.</p>
<p>The construction of the basins and the height and diameter of the jets 
were precisely similar to those I have already described.&nbsp; All these 
sixteen springs are so near each other that they do not even occupy two 
sides of the rock.&nbsp; It is impossible to form an idea of the 
magnificence of this singular spectacle, which becomes really fairy-like, 
if the beholder have the courage to climb the rock itself, a proceeding of 
some danger, though of little difficulty.&nbsp; The upper stratum of the 
rock is soft and warm, presenting almost the appearance of mud thickened 
with sand and small stones.&nbsp; Every footstep leaves a trace behind it, 
and the visitor has continually before his eyes the fear of breaking 
through, and falling into a hot spring hidden from view by a thin 
covering.&nbsp; The good pastor walked in advance of me, with a stick, and 
probed the dangerous surface as much as possible.&nbsp; I was loath to stay
behind, and suddenly we found ourselves at the summit of the rock.&nbsp; 
Here we could take in, at one view, the sixteen springs gushing from both 
its sides.&nbsp; If the view from below had been most interesting and 
singular, how shall I describe its appearance as seen from above?&nbsp; 
Sixteen jets of water seen at one glance, sixteen reservoirs, in all their 
diversity of form and construction, opening at once beneath the feet of the
beholder, seemed almost too wonderful a sight.&nbsp; Forgetting all 
pusillanimous feelings, I stood and honoured the Creator in these his 
marvellous works.&nbsp; For a long time I stood, and could not tire of 
gazing into the abysses from whose darkness the masses of white and foaming
water sprung hissing into the air, to fall again, and hasten in quiet union
towards the neighbouring river.&nbsp; The good pastor found it necessary to
remind me several times that our position here was neither of the safest 
nor of the most comfortable, and that it was therefore high time to abandon
it.&nbsp; I had ceased to think of the insecurity of the ground we trod, 
and scarcely noticed the mighty clouds of hot vapour which frequently 
surrounded and threatened to suffocate us, obliging us to step suddenly 
back with wetted faces.&nbsp; It was fortunate that these waters contain 
but a very small quantity of brimstone, otherwise we could scarcely have 
long maintained our elevated position.</p>
<p>The rock from which these springs rise is formed of a reddish mass, and 
the bed of the river into which the water flows is also completely covered 
with little stones of the same colour.</p>
<p>On our way back we noticed, near a cottage, another remarkable 
phenomenon.&nbsp; It was a basin, in whose depths the water boils and 
bubbles violently; and near this basin are two unsightly holes, from which 
columns of smoke periodically rise with a great noise.&nbsp; Whilst this is
going on, the basin fills itself more and more with water, but never so 
much as to overflow, or to force a jet of water into the air; then the 
steam and the noise cease in both cavities, and the water in the reservoir 
sinks several feet.</p>
<p>This strange phenomenon generally lasts about a minute, and is repeated 
so regularly, that a bet could almost be made, that the rising and falling 
of the water, and the increased and lessened noise of the steam, shall be 
seen and heard sixty or sixty-five times within an hour.</p>
<p>In communication with this basin is another, situate at a distance of 
about a hundred paces in a small hollow, and filled like the former with 
boiling water.&nbsp; As the water in the upper basin gradually sinks, and 
ceases to seethe, it begins to rise in the lower one, and is at length 
forced two or three feet into the air; then it falls again, and thus the 
phenomenon is continually repeated in the upper and the lower basin 
alternately.</p>
<p>At the upper spring there is also a vapour-bath.&nbsp; This is formed by
a small chamber situate hard by the basin, built of stones and roofed with 
turf.&nbsp; It is further provided with a small and narrow entrance, which 
cannot be passed in an upright position.&nbsp; The floor is composed of 
stone slabs, probably covering a hot spring, for they are very warm.&nbsp; 
The person wishing to use this bath betakes himself to this room, and 
carefully closes every cranny; a suffocating heat, which induces violent 
perspiration over the whole frame, is thus generated.&nbsp; The people, 
however, seldom avail themselves of this bath.</p>
<p>On my return I had still to visit a basin with a jet of water, in a fine
meadow near the church; a low wall of stone has been erected round this 
spring to prevent the cattle from scalding themselves if they should 
approach too near in the ardour of grazing.&nbsp; Some eighty paces off is 
to be seen the wool-bath erected by Snorri Sturluson.&nbsp; It consists of 
a stone basin three or four feet in depth, and eighteen or twenty in 
diameter.&nbsp; The approach is by a few steps leading to a low stone 
bench, which runs round the basin.&nbsp; The water is obtained from the 
neighbouring spring, but is of so high a temperature that it is impossible 
to bathe without previously cooling it.&nbsp; The bath stands in the open 
air, and no traces are left of the building which once covered it.&nbsp; It
is now used for clothes and sheep&rsquo;s wool.</p>
<p>I had now seen all the interesting springs on this side of the 
valley.&nbsp; Some columns of vapour, which may be observed from the 
opposite end of the valley, proceed from thermal springs, that offer no 
remarkable feature save their heat.</p>
<p>On our return the priest took me to the churchyard, which lay at some 
distance from his dwelling, and showed me the principal graves.&nbsp; 
Though I thought the sight very impressive, it was not calculated to 
invigorate me, when I considered that I must pass the approaching night 
alone in the church, amidst these resting-places of the departed.</p>
<p>The mound above each grave is very high, and the greater part of them 
are surmounted by a kind of wooden coffin, which at first sight conveys the
impression that the dead person is above ground.&nbsp; I could not shake 
off a feeling of discomfort; and such is the power of prejudice, 
that&mdash;I acknowledge my weakness&mdash;I was even induced to beg that 
the priest would remove one of the covers.&nbsp; Though I knew full well 
that the dead man was slumbering deep in the earth, and not in this coffin,
I felt a shudder pass over me as the lid was removed, and I saw&mdash;as 
the priest had assured me I should do&mdash;merely a tombstone with the 
usual inscription, which this coffin-like covering is intended to protect 
against the rude storms of the winter.</p>
<p>Close beside the entrance to the church is the mound beneath which rest 
the bones of Snorri Sturluson, the celebrated poet; <a 
name="citation39"></a><a href="#footnote39" class="citation">[39]</a> over 
this grave stands a small runic stone of the length of the mound 
itself.&nbsp; This stone is said to have once been completely covered with 
runic characters; but all trace of these has been swept away by the storms 
of five hundred winters, against which the tomb had no protecting 
coffin.&nbsp; The stone, too, is split throughout its entire length into 
two pieces.&nbsp; The mound above the grave is often renewed, so that the 
beholder could often fancy he saw a new-made grave.&nbsp; I picked all the 
buttercups I could find growing on the grave, and preserved them carefully 
in a book.&nbsp; Perhaps I may be able to give pleasure to several of my 
countrywomen by offering them a floweret from the grave of the greatest of 
Icelandic poets.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">June 19th.</p>
<p>In order to pursue my journey without interruption, I hired fresh 
horses, and allowed my own, which were rather fatigued, to accompany us 
unloaded.&nbsp; My object in this further excursion was to visit the very 
remarkable cavern of Surthellir, distant a good thirty-three miles from 
this place.&nbsp; The clergyman was again kind enough to make the necessary
arrangements for me, and even to act as my Mentor on the journey.</p>
<p>Though we were only three strong, we departed with a retinue of seven 
horses, and for nearly ten miles rode back the same way by which I had come
from Reikholt on the preceding morning; then we turned off to the left, and
crossing hills and acclivities, reached other valleys, which were partly 
traversed by beautiful streams of lava, and partly interspersed with 
forests&mdash;<i>forests</i>, as I have already said, according to 
Icelandic notions.&nbsp; The separate stems were certainly slightly higher 
than those in the valley of Thingvalla.</p>
<p>At Kalmannstunga we left the spare horses, and took with us a man to 
serve as guide in the cavern, from which we were now still some seven miles
distant.&nbsp; The great valley in which this cavern lies is reckoned among
the most remarkable in Iceland.&nbsp; It is a most perfect picture of 
volcanic devastation.&nbsp; The most beautiful masses of lava, in the most 
varied and picturesque forms, occupy the whole immeasurable valley.&nbsp; 
Lava is to be seen there in a rough glassy state, forming exquisite flames 
and arabesques; and in immense slabs, lying sometimes scattered, sometimes 
piled in strata one above the other, as though they had been cast there by 
a flood.&nbsp; Among these, again, lie mighty isolated streams, which must 
have been frozen in the midst of their course.&nbsp; From the different 
colours of the lava, and their transitions from light grey to black, we can
judge of the eruptions which have taken place at different periods.&nbsp; 
The mountains surrounding this valley are mostly of a sombre hue; some are 
even black, forming a striking contrast to the neighbouring jokuls, which, 
in their large expanse, present the appearance almost of a sea of 
ice.&nbsp; I found one of these jokuls of a remarkable size; its shining 
expanse extended far down into the valley, and its upper surface was almost
immeasurable.</p>
<p>The other mountains were all smooth, as though polished by art; in the 
foreground I only noticed one which was covered with wonderful forms of 
dried lava.&nbsp; A deathlike silence weighed on the whole country round, 
on hill and on valley alike.&nbsp; Every thing seemed dead, all round was 
barren and desert, so that the effect was truly Icelandic.&nbsp; The 
greater portion of Iceland might be with justice designated the 
&ldquo;Northern Desert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cavern of Surthellir lies on a slightly elevated extended plain, 
where it would certainly not be sought for, as we are accustomed to see 
natural phenomena of this description only in the bowels of rocks.&nbsp; It
is, therefore, with no little surprise that the traveller sees suddenly 
opening before him a large round basin about fifteen fathoms in diameter, 
and four in depth.&nbsp; It was with a feeling of awe that I looked 
downwards on the countless blocks of rock piled one upon the other, 
extending on one side to the edge of the hollow, across which the road led 
to the dark ravines farther on.</p>
<p>We were compelled to scramble forward on our hands and knees, until we 
reached a long broad passage, which led us at first imperceptibly 
downwards, and then ran underneath the plain, which formed a rocky cavern 
above our heads.&nbsp; I estimated the different heights of this roof at 
not less than from eighteen to sixty feet; but it seldom reached a greater 
elevation than the latter.&nbsp; Both roof and walls are in some places 
very pointed and rough: a circumstance to be ascribed to the stalactites 
which adhere to them, without, however, forming figures or long sharp 
points.</p>
<p>From this principal path several smaller ones lead far into the interior
of this stony region; but they do not communicate with each other, and one 
is compelled to return from each side-path into the main road.&nbsp; Some 
of these by-paths are short, narrow, and low; others, on the contrary, are 
long, broad, and lofty.</p>
<p>In one of the most retired of these by-paths I was shewn a great number 
of bones, which, I was told, were those of slaughtered sheep and other 
animals.&nbsp; I could gather, from the account given by the priest of the 
legend concerning them, that, in days of yore, this cave was the resort of 
a mighty band of robbers.&nbsp; This must have been a long, long time ago, 
as this is related as a legend or a fable.</p>
<p>For my part, I could not tell what robbers had to do in Iceland.&nbsp; 
Pirates had often come to the island; but for these gentry this cavern was 
too far from the sea.&nbsp; I cannot even imagine beasts of prey to have 
been there; for the whole country round about is desert and uninhabited, so
that they could have found nothing to prey upon.&nbsp; In fact, I turned 
over in my mind every probability, and can only say that it appeared to me 
a most remarkable circumstance to find in this desert place, so far from 
any living thing, a number of bones, which, moreover, looked as fresh as if
the poor animals to whom they once belonged had been eaten but a short time
ago.&nbsp; Unfortunately I could obtain no satisfactory information on this
point.</p>
<p>It is difficult to imagine any thing more laborious than to wander about
in this cavern.&nbsp; As the road had shewed itself at the entrance of the 
cavern, so it continued throughout its whole extent.&nbsp; The path 
consisted entirely of loose fragments of lava heaped one upon the other, 
over which we had to clamber with great labour.&nbsp; None of us could 
afford to help the others; each one was fully occupied with himself.&nbsp; 
There was not a single spot to be seen on which we could have stood without
holding fast at the same time with our hands.&nbsp; We were sometimes 
obliged to seat ourselves on a stone, and so to slide down; at others, to 
take hands and pull one another to the top of high blocks of stone.</p>
<p>We came to several immense basins, or craters, which opened above our 
heads, but were inaccessible, the sides being too steep for us to 
climb.&nbsp; The light which entered through these openings was scarcely 
enough to illumine the principal path, much less the numerous by-paths.</p>
<p>At Kalmannstunga I had endeavoured to procure torches, but was obliged 
to consider myself fortunate in getting a few tapers.&nbsp; It is necessary
to provide oneself with torches at Reikjavik.</p>
<p>The parts of the cavern beneath the open craters were still covered with
a considerable quantity of snow, by which our progress was rendered very 
dangerous.&nbsp; We frequently sunk in, and at other times caught our feet 
between the stones, so that we could scarcely maintain our balance.&nbsp; 
In the by-paths situated near these openings an icy rind had formed itself,
which was now covered with water.&nbsp; Farther on, the ice had melted; but
it was generally very dirty, as a stratum of sand mixed with water lay 
there in place of the stones.&nbsp; The chief path alone was covered with 
blocks of lava; in the smaller paths I found only strata of sand and small 
pieces of lava.</p>
<p>The magical illumination produced by the sun&rsquo;s rays shining 
through one of these craters into the cavern produced a splendid 
effect.&nbsp; The sun shone perpendicularly through the opening, spread a 
dazzling radiance over the snow, and diffused a pale delicate light around 
us.&nbsp; The effect of this point of dazzling light was the more 
remarkable from its contrasting strongly with the two dark chasms, from the
first of which we had emerged to continue our journey through the obscurity
of the second.</p>
<p>This subterranean labyrinth is said to extend in different directions 
for many miles.&nbsp; We explored a portion of the chief path and several 
by-paths, and after a march of two hours returned heartily tired to the 
upper world.&nbsp; We then rested a quarter of an hour, and afterwards 
returned at a good round pace to Kalmannstunga.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I do not possess sufficient geognostic knowledge to be 
able to set this cavern down as an extinct volcano.&nbsp; But in travelling
in a country where every hill and mountain, every thing around, in fact, 
consists of lava, even the uninitiated in science seeks to discover the 
openings whence these immense masses have poured.&nbsp; The stranger 
curiously regards the top of each mountain, thinking every where to behold 
a crater, but both hill and dale appear smooth and closed.&nbsp; With what 
joy then does he hail the thought of having discovered, in this cavern, 
something to throw light upon the sources of these things!&nbsp; I, at 
least, fancied myself walking on the hearth of an extinct volcano; for all 
I saw, from the masses of stone piled beneath my feet and the immense basin
above my head, were both of lava.&nbsp; If I am right in my conjecture, I 
do not know; I only speak according to my notions and my views.</p>
<p>I was obliged to pass this night in a cottage.&nbsp; Kalmannstunga 
contains three such cottages, but no chapel.&nbsp; Luckily I found one of 
these houses somewhat larger and more cleanly than its neighbours; it could
almost come under the denomination of a farm.&nbsp; The occupants, too, had
been employed during my ride to the cavern in cleansing the best chamber, 
and preparing it, as far as possible, for my reception.&nbsp; The room in 
question was eleven feet long by seven broad; the window was so small and 
so covered with dirt that, although the sun was shining in its full glory, 
I could scarcely see to write.&nbsp; The walls, and even the floor, were 
boarded&mdash;a great piece of luxury in a country where wood is so 
scarce.&nbsp; The furniture consisted of a broad bedstead, two chests of 
drawers, and a small table.&nbsp; Chairs and benches are a kind of <i>terra
incognita</i> in the dwellings of the Icelandic peasantry; besides, I do 
not know where such articles could be stowed in a room of such dimensions 
as that which I occupied.</p>
<p>My hostess, the widow of a wealthy peasant, introduced to me her four 
children, who were very handsome, and very neatly dressed.&nbsp; I begged 
the good mother to tell me the names of the young ones, so that I might at 
least know a few Icelandic names.&nbsp; She appeared much flattered at my 
request, and gave me the names as follows: Sigrudur, Gudrun, Ingeb&ouml;r, 
and Lars.</p>
<p>I should have felt tolerably comfortable in my present quarters, 
accustomed as I am to bear privations of all kinds with indifference, if 
they would but have left me in peace.&nbsp; But the reader may fancy my 
horror when the whole population, not only of the cottage itself, but also 
of the neighbouring dwellings, made their appearance, and, planting 
themselves partly in my chamber and partly at the door, held me in a far 
closer state of siege than even at Krisuvik.&nbsp; I was, it appeared, 
quite a novel phenomenon in the eyes of these good people, and so they came
one and all and stared at me; the women and children were, in particular, 
most unpleasantly familiar; they felt my dress, and the little ones laid 
their dirty little countenances in my lap.&nbsp; Added to this, the 
confined atmosphere from the number of persons present, their lamentable 
want of cleanliness, and their filthy habit of spitting, &amp;c., all 
combined to form a most dreadful whole.&nbsp; During these visits I did 
more penance than by the longest fasts; and fasting, too, was an exercise I
seldom escaped, as I could touch few Icelandic dishes.&nbsp; The cookery of
the Icelandic peasants is wholly confined to the preparation of dried fish,
with which they eat fermented milk that has often been kept for months; on 
very rare occasions they have a preparation of barley-meal, which is eaten 
with flat bread baked from Icelandic moss ground fine.</p>
<p>I could not but wonder at the fact that most of these people expected to
find me acquainted with a number of things generally studied only by men; 
they seemed to have a notion that in foreign parts women should be as 
learned as men.&nbsp; So, for instance, the priests always inquired if I 
spoke Latin, and seemed much surprised on finding that I was unacquainted 
with the language.&nbsp; The common people requested my advice as to the 
mode of treating divers complaints; and once, in the course of one of my 
solitary wanderings about Reikjavik, on my entering a cottage, they brought
before me a being whom I should scarcely have recognised as belonging to 
the same species as myself, so fearfully was he disfigured by the eruption 
called &ldquo;lepra.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not only the face, but the whole body 
also was covered with it; the patient was quite emaciated, and some parts 
of his body were covered with sores.&nbsp; For a surgeon this might have 
been an interesting sight, but I turned away in disgust.</p>
<p>But let us turn from this picture.&nbsp; I would rather tell of the 
angel&rsquo;s face I saw in Kalmannstunga.&nbsp; It was a girl, ten or 
twelve years of age, beautiful and lovely beyond description, so that I 
wished I had been a painter.&nbsp; How gladly would I have taken home with 
me to my own land, if only on canvass, the delicate face, with its roguish 
dimples and speaking eyes!&nbsp; But perhaps it is better as it is; the 
picture might by some unlucky chance have fallen into the hands of some 
too-susceptible youth, who, like Don Sylvio de Rosalva, in Wieland&rsquo;s 
<i>Comical Romance</i>, would immediately have proceeded to travel through 
half the world to find the original of this enchanting portrait.&nbsp; His 
spirit of inquiry would scarcely have carried him to Iceland, as such an 
apparition would never be suspected to exist in such a country, and thus 
the unhappy youth would be doomed to endless wandering.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">June 20th.</p>
<p>The distance from Kalmannstunga to Thingvalla is fifty-two miles, and 
the journey is certainly one of the most dreary and fatiguing of all that 
can be made in Iceland.&nbsp; The traveller passes from one desert valley 
into another; he is always surrounded by high mountains and still higher 
glaciers, and wherever he turns his eyes, nature seems torpid and 
dead.&nbsp; A feeling of anxious discomfort seizes upon the wanderer, he 
hastens with redoubled speed through the far-stretched deserts, and eagerly
ascends the mountains piled up before him, in the hope that better things 
lie beyond.&nbsp; It is in vain; he only sees the same solitudes, the same 
deserts, the same mountains.</p>
<p>On the elevated plateaux several places were still covered with snow; 
these we were obliged to cross, though we could frequently hear the rushing
of the water beneath its snowy covering.&nbsp; We were compelled also to 
pass over coatings of ice spread lightly over rivers, and presenting that 
blue colour which is a certain sign of danger.</p>
<p>Our poor horses were sometimes very restive; but it was of no use; they 
were beaten without mercy until they carried us over the dangerous 
places.&nbsp; The pack-horse was always driven on in front with many blows;
it had to serve as pioneer, and try if the road was practicable.&nbsp; Next
came my guide, and I brought up the rear.&nbsp; Our poor horses frequently 
sank up to their knees in the snow, and twice up to the 
saddle-girths.&nbsp; This was one of the most dangerous rides I have ever 
had.&nbsp; I could not help continually thinking what I should do if my 
guide were to sink in so deeply that he could not extricate himself; my 
strength would not have been sufficient to rescue him, and whither should I
turn to seek for help?&nbsp; All around us was nothing but a desert and 
snow.&nbsp; Perhaps my lot might have been to die of hunger.&nbsp; I should
have wandered about seeking dwellings and human beings, and have entangled 
myself so completely among these wastes that I could never have found my 
way.</p>
<p>When at a distance I descried a new field of snow (and unfortunately we 
came upon them but too frequently), I felt very uncomfortable; those alone 
who have themselves been in a similar situation can estimate the whole 
extent of my anxiety.</p>
<p>If I had been travelling in company with others, these fears would not 
have disturbed me; for there reciprocal assistance can be rendered, and the
consciousness of this fact seems materially to diminish the danger.</p>
<p>During the season in which the snow ceases to form a secure covering, 
this road is but little travelled.&nbsp; We saw nowhere a trace of 
footsteps, either of men or animals; we were the only living beings in this
dreadful region.&nbsp; I certainly scolded my guide roundly for bringing me
by such a road.&nbsp; But what did I gain by this?&nbsp; It would have been
as dangerous to turn back as to go on.</p>
<p>A change in the weather, which till now had been rather favourable, 
increased the difficulties of this journey.&nbsp; Already when we left 
Kalmannstunga, the sky began to be overcast, and the sun enlivened us with 
its rays only for a few minutes at a time.&nbsp; On our reaching the higher
mountains the weather became worse; for here we encountered clouds and fog,
which wreaked their vengeance upon us, and which only careered by to make 
room for others.&nbsp; An icy storm from the neighbouring glaciers was 
their constant companion, and made me shiver so much that I could scarcely 
keep my saddle.&nbsp; We had now ridden above thirteen hours.&nbsp; The 
rain poured down incessantly, and we were half dead with cold and wet; so I
at length determined to halt for the night at the first cottage: at last we
found one between two or three miles from Thingvalla.&nbsp; I had now a 
roof above my head; but beyond this I had gained nothing.&nbsp; The cottage
consisted of a single room, and was almost completely filled by four broad 
bedsteads.&nbsp; I counted seven adults and three children, who had all to 
be accommodated in these four beds.&nbsp; In addition to this, the kvef, a 
kind of croup, prevailed this spring to such an extent that scarcely any 
one escaped it.&nbsp; Wherever I went, I found the people afflicted with 
this complaint; and here this was also the case; the noise of groaning and 
coughing on all sides was quite deplorable.&nbsp; The floor, moreover, was 
revoltingly dirty.</p>
<p>The good people were so kind as immediately to place one of their beds 
at my disposal; but I would rather have passed the night on the threshold 
of the door than in this disgusting hole.&nbsp; I chose for my 
lodging-place the narrow passage which separated the kitchen from the room;
I found there a couple of blocks, across which a few boards had been laid, 
and this constituted the milk-room: it might have been more properly called
the smoke-room; for in the roof were a few air-holes, through which the 
smoke escaped.&nbsp; In this smoke or milk-room&mdash;whichever it may be 
called&mdash;I prepared to pass the night as best I could.&nbsp; My cloak 
being wet through, I had been compelled to hang it on a stick to dry; and 
thus found myself under the necessity of borrowing a mattress from these 
unhealthy people.&nbsp; I laid myself down boldly, and pretended 
sleepiness, in order to deliver myself from the curiosity of my 
entertainers.&nbsp; They retired to their room, and so I was alone and 
undisturbed.&nbsp; But yet I could not sleep; the cold wind, blowing in 
upon me through the air-holes, chilled and wetted as I already was, kept me
awake against my will.&nbsp; I had also another misfortune to endure.&nbsp;
As often as I attempted to sit upright on my luxurious couch, my head would
receive a severe concussion.&nbsp; I had forgotten the poles which are 
fixed across each of these antechambers, for the purpose of hanging up fish
to dry, &amp;c.&nbsp; Unfortunately I could not bear this arrangement in 
mind until after I had received half a dozen salutations of this 
description.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">June 21st.</p>
<p>At length the morning so long sighed for came; the rain had indeed 
ceased; but the clouds still hung about the mountains, and promised a 
speedy fall; I nevertheless resolved rather to submit myself to the fury of
the elements than to remain longer in my present quarters, and so ordered 
the horses to be saddled.</p>
<p>Before my departure roast lamb and butter were offered me.&nbsp; I 
thanked my entertainers; but refrained from tasting any thing, excusing 
myself on the plea of not feeling hungry, which was in reality the case; 
for if I only looked at the dirty people who surrounded me, my appetite 
vanished instantly.&nbsp; So long as my stock of bread and cheese lasted, I
kept to it, and ate nothing else.</p>
<p>Taking leave of my good hosts, we continued our journey to Reikjavik, by
the same road on which I had travelled on my journey hither.&nbsp; This had
not been my original plan on starting from Reikjavik; I had intended to 
proceed from Thingvalla directly to the Geyser, to Hecla, &amp;c.; but the 
horses were already exhausted, and the weather so dreadfully bad, without 
prospect of speedy amendment, that I preferred returning to Reikjavik, and 
waiting for better times in my pleasant little room at the house of the 
good baker.</p>
<p>We rode on as well as we could amidst ceaseless storms of wind and 
rain.&nbsp; The most disagreeable circumstance of all was our being obliged
to spend the hours devoted to rest in the open air, under a by no means 
cloudless sky, as during our whole day&rsquo;s journey we saw not a single 
hut, save the solitary one in the lava desert, which serves as a 
resting-place for travellers during the winter.&nbsp; So we continued our 
journey until we reached a scanty meadow.&nbsp; Here I had my choice either
to walk about for two hours, or to sit down upon the wet grass.&nbsp; I 
could find nothing better to do than to turn my back upon the wind and 
rain, to remain standing on one spot, to have patience, and for amusement 
to observe the direction in which the clouds scudded by.&nbsp; At the same 
time I discussed my frugal meal, more for want of something to do than from
hunger; if I felt thirsty, I had only to turn round and open my mouth.</p>
<p>If there are natures peculiarly fitted for travelling, I am fortunate in
being blessed with such an one.&nbsp; No rain or wind was powerful enough 
to give me even a cold.&nbsp; During this whole excursion I had tasted no 
warm or nourishing food; I had slept every night upon a bench or a chest; 
had ridden nearly 255 miles in six days; and had besides scrambled about 
bravely in the cavern of Surthellir; and, in spite of all this privation 
and fatigue, I arrived at Reikjavik in good health and spirits.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<p>The weather soon cleared up, and I continued my journey to the Geyser 
and to Mount Hecla on the 24th June.&nbsp; On the first day, when we rode 
to Thingvalla, we passed no new scenery, but saw instead an extremely 
beautiful atmospheric phenomenon.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p0b.jpg">
<img alt="The Geysers" src="images/p0s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>As we approached the lake, some thin mist-clouds lowered over it and 
over the earth, so that it seemed as if it would rain.&nbsp; One portion of
the firmament glowed with the brightest blue; while the other part was 
obscured by thick clouds, through which the sun was just breaking.&nbsp; 
Some of its rays reached the clouds of mist, and illuminated them in a 
wonderfully beautiful manner.&nbsp; The most delicate shades of colour 
seemed breathed, as it were, over them like a dissolving rainbow, whose 
glowing colours were intermingled and yet singly perceptible.&nbsp; This 
play of colours continued for half an hour, then faded gradually till it 
vanished entirely, and the ordinary atmosphere took its place.&nbsp; It was
one of the most beautiful appearances I had ever witnessed.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">June 25th.</p>
<p>The roads separate about a mile behind the little town of Thingvalla; 
the one to the left goes to Reikholt, the right-hand one leads to the 
Geyser.&nbsp; We rode for some time along the shores of the lake, and found
at the end of the valley an awful chasm in the rock, similar to the one of 
Almanagiau, which we had passed on such a wretched road.</p>
<p>The contiguous valley bore a great resemblance to that of Thingvalla; 
but the third one was again fearful.&nbsp; Lava covered it, and was quite 
overgrown with that whitish moss, which has a beautiful appearance when it 
only covers a portion of the lava, and when black masses rise above it, but
which here presented a most monotonous aspect.</p>
<p>We also passed two grottoes which opened at our feet.&nbsp; At the 
entrance of one stood a pillar of rock supporting an immense slab of lava, 
which formed an awe-inspiring portal.&nbsp; I had unfortunately not known 
of the existence of these caves, and was consequently unprepared to visit 
them.&nbsp; Torches, at least, would have been requisite.&nbsp; But I 
subsequently heard that they were not at all deep, and contained nothing of
interest.</p>
<p>In the course of the day we passed through valleys such as I had seen 
nowhere else in Iceland.&nbsp; Beautiful meadow-lawns, perfectly level, 
covered the country for miles.&nbsp; These rich valleys were, of course, 
tolerably well populated; we frequently passed three or four contiguous 
cottages, and saw horses, cows, and sheep grazing on these fields in 
considerable numbers.</p>
<p>The mountains which bounded these valleys on the left seemed to me very 
remarkable; they were partly brown, black, or dark blue, like the others; 
but the bulk of which they were composed I considered to be fine loam-soil 
layers, if I may trust my imperfect mineralogical knowledge.&nbsp; Some of 
these mountains were topped by large isolated lava rocks, real giants; and 
it seemed inexplicable to me how they could stand on the soft soil 
beneath.</p>
<p>In one of these valleys we passed a considerable lake, on and around 
which rose circling clouds of steam proceeding from hot springs, but of no 
great size.&nbsp; But after we had already travelled about twenty-five 
miles, we came to the most remarkable object I had ever met with; this was 
a river with a most peculiar bed.</p>
<p>This river-bed is broad and somewhat steep; it consists of lava strata, 
and is divided lengthwise in the middle by a cleft eighteen to twenty feet 
deep, and fifteen to eighteen feet broad, towards which the bubbling and 
surging waters rush, so that the sound is heard at some distance.&nbsp; A 
little wooden bridge, which stands in the middle of the stream, and over 
which the high waves constantly play, leads over the chasm.&nbsp; Any one 
not aware of the fact can hardly explain this appearance to himself, nor 
understand the noise and surging of the stream.&nbsp; The little bridge in 
the centre would be taken for the ruins of a fallen bridge, and the chasm 
is not seen from the shore, because the foaming waves overtop it.&nbsp; An 
indescribable fear would seize upon the traveller when he beheld the 
venturous guide ride into the stream, and was obliged to follow without 
pity or mercy.</p>
<p>The priest of Thingvalla had prepared me for the scene, and had advised 
me to <i>walk</i> over the bridge; but as the water at this season stood so
high that the waves from both sides dashed two feet above the bridge, I 
could not descend from my horse, and was obliged to ride across.</p>
<p>The whole passage through the stream is so peculiar, that it must be 
seen, and can scarcely be described.&nbsp; The water gushes and plays on 
all sides with fearful force; it rushes into the chasm with impetuous 
violence, forms waterfalls on both sides, and breaks itself on the 
projecting rocks.&nbsp; Not far from the bridge the cleft terminates; and 
the whole breadth of the waters falls over rocks thirty to forty feet 
high.&nbsp; The nearer we approached the centre, the deeper, more violent, 
and impetuous grew the stream, and the more deafening was the noise.&nbsp; 
The horses became restless and shy; and when we came to the bridge, they 
began to tremble, they reared, they turned to all sides but the right one, 
and refused to obey the bridle.&nbsp; With infinite trouble we at last 
succeeded in bringing them across this dangerous place.</p>
<p>The valley which is traversed by this peculiar river is narrow, and 
quite enclosed by lava mountains and hills; the inanimate, silent nature 
around is perfectly adapted to imprint this scene for ever on the 
traveller&rsquo;s memory.</p>
<p>This remarkable stream had been the last difficulty; and now we 
proceeded quietly and safely through the beautiful valleys till we 
approached the Geyser, which a projecting hillock enviously concealed from 
my anxiously curious gaze.&nbsp; At last this hillock was passed; and I saw
the Geyser with its surrounding scenery, with its immense steam pillars, 
and the clouds and cloudlets rising from it.&nbsp; The hill was about two 
miles distant from the Geyser and the other hot springs.&nbsp; There they 
were, boiling and bubbling all around, and through the midst lay the road 
to the basin.&nbsp; Eighty paces from it we halted.</p>
<p>And now I stood before the chief object of my journey; I saw it, it was 
so near me, and yet I did not venture to approach it.&nbsp; But a peasant 
who had followed us from one of the neighbouring cottages, and had probably
guessed my anxiety and my fear, took me by the hand and constituted himself
my cicerone.&nbsp; He had unfortunately, it being Sunday, paid too great a 
devotion to the brandy-bottle, so that he staggered rather than walked, and
I hesitated to trust myself to the guidance of this man, not knowing 
whether he had reason enough left to distinguish how far we might with 
safety venture.&nbsp; My guide, who had accompanied me from Reikjavik, 
assured me indeed that I might trust him in spite of his intoxication, and 
that he would himself go with us to translate the peasant&rsquo;s Icelandic
jargon into Danish; but nevertheless I followed with great trepidation.</p>
<p>He led me to the margin of the basin of the great Geyser, which lies on 
the top of a gentle elevation of about ten feet, and contains the outer and
the inner basins.&nbsp; The diameter of the outer basin may be about thirty
feet; that of the inner one six to seven feet.&nbsp; Both were filled to 
the brim, the water was pure as crystal, but boiled and bubbled only 
slightly.&nbsp; We soon left this spot; for when the basins are quite 
filled with water it is very dangerous to approach them, as they may empty 
themselves any moment by an eruption.&nbsp; We therefore went to inspect 
the other springs.</p>
<p>My unsteady guide pointed those out which we might unhesitatingly 
approach, and warned me from the others.&nbsp; Then we returned to the 
great Geyser, where he gave me some precautionary rules, in case of an 
intervening eruption, and then left me to prepare some accommodation for my
stay.&nbsp; I will briefly enumerate the rules he gave me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The pillar of water always rises perpendicularly, and the 
overflowing water has its chief outlets on one and the same side.&nbsp; The
water does indeed escape on the other side, but only in inconsiderable 
quantities, and in shapeless little ducts, which one may easily 
evade.&nbsp; On this side one may therefore approach within forty paces 
even during the most violent eruptions.&nbsp; The eruption announces itself
by a dull roaring; and as soon as this is heard, the traveller must hastily
retire to the above-named distance, as the eruption always follows very 
quickly after the noise.&nbsp; The water, however, does not rise high every
time, often only very inconsiderably, so that, to see a very fine 
explosion, it is often necessary to stay some days here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The French scholar, M. P. Geimard, has provided for the accommodation of
travellers with a truly noble disinterestedness.&nbsp; He traversed the 
whole of Iceland some years ago and left two large tents behind him; one 
here, and the other in Thingvalla.&nbsp; The one here is particularly 
appropriate, as travellers are frequently obliged, as stated above, to wait
several days for a fine eruption.&nbsp; Every traveller certainly owes M. 
Geimard the warmest thanks for this convenience.&nbsp; A peasant, the same 
who guides travellers to the springs, has the charge of it, and is bound to
pitch it for any one for a fee of one or two florins.</p>
<p>When my tent was ready it was nearly eleven o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; My 
companions retired, and I remained alone.</p>
<p>It is usual to watch through the night in order not to miss an 
eruption.&nbsp; Now, although an alternate watching is no very arduous 
matter for several travellers, it became a very hard task for me alone, and
an Icelandic peasant cannot be trusted; an eruption of Mount Hecla would 
scarcely arouse him.</p>
<p>I sat sometimes before and sometimes in my tent, and listened with 
anxious expectation for the coming events; at last, after 
midnight&mdash;the witching hour&mdash;I heard some hollow sounds, as if a 
cannon were being fired at a great distance, and its echoing sounds were 
borne by the breeze.&nbsp; I rushed from my tent and expected subterranean 
noises, violent cracking and trembling of the earth, according to the 
descriptions I had read.&nbsp; I could scarcely repress a slight sensation 
of fear.&nbsp; To be alone at midnight in such a scene is certainly no 
joke.</p>
<p>Many of my friends may remember my telling them, before my departure, 
that I expected I should need the most courage on my Icelandic journey 
during the nights at the Geyser.</p>
<p>These hollow sounds were repeated, at very short intervals, thirteen 
times; and each time the basin overflowed and ejected a considerable 
quantity of water.&nbsp; The sounds did not seem to proceed from 
subterranean ragings, but from the violent agitation of the waters.&nbsp; 
In a minute and a half all was over; the water no longer overflowed, the 
caldron and basin remained filled, and I returned to my tent disappointed 
in every way.&nbsp; This phenomenon was repeated every two hours and a 
half, or, at the latest, every three hours and a half.&nbsp; I saw and 
heard nothing else all night, the next day, or the second night.&nbsp; I 
waited in vain for an eruption.</p>
<p>When I had accustomed myself to these temporary effusions of my 
neighbour, I either indulged in a gentle slumber in the intermediate time, 
or I visited the other springs and explored.&nbsp; I wished to discover the
boiling vapour and the coloured springs which many travellers assert they 
have seen here.</p>
<p>All the hot-springs are united with a circumference of 800 to 900 paces:
several of them are very remarkable, but the majority insignificant.</p>
<p>They are situated in the angle of an immense valley at the foot of a 
hill, behind which extends a chain of mountains.&nbsp; The valley is 
entirely covered with grass, and the vegetation only decreases a little in 
the immediate vicinity of the springs.&nbsp; Cottages are built every where
in the neighbourhood; the nearest to the springs are only about 700 to 800 
paces distant.</p>
<p>I counted twelve large basins with boiling and gushing springs; of 
smaller ones there were many more.</p>
<p>Among the gushing springs the Strokker is the most remarkable.&nbsp; It 
boils and bubbles with most extraordinary violence at a depth of about 
twenty feet, shoots up suddenly, and projects its waters into the 
air.&nbsp; Its eruptions sometimes last half an hour, and the column 
occasionally ascends to a height of forty feet.&nbsp; I witnessed several 
of its eruptions; but unfortunately not one of the largest.&nbsp; The 
highest I saw could not have been above thirty feet, and did not last more 
than a quarter of an hour.&nbsp; The Strokker is the only spring, except 
the Geyser, which has to be approached with great caution.&nbsp; The 
eruptions sometimes succeed each other quickly, and sometimes cease for a 
few hours, and are not preceded by any sign.&nbsp; Another spring spouts 
constantly, but never higher than three to four feet.&nbsp; A third one 
lies about four or five feet deep, in a rather broad basin, and produces 
only a few little bubbles.&nbsp; But this calmness is deceptive: it seldom 
lasts more than half a minute, rarely two or three minutes; then the spring
begins to bubble, to boil, and to wave and spout to a height of two or 
three feet; without, however, reaching the level of the basin.&nbsp; In 
some springs I heard boiling and foaming like a gentle bellowing; but saw 
no water, sometimes not even steam, rising.</p>
<p>Two of the most remarkable springs which can perhaps be found in the 
world are situated immediately above the Geyser, in two openings, which are
separated by a wall of rock scarcely a foot wide.&nbsp; This partition does
not rise above the surface of the soil, but descends into the earth; the 
water boils slowly, and has an equable, moderate discharge.&nbsp; The 
beauty of these springs consists in their remarkable transparency.&nbsp; 
All the varied forms and caves, the projecting peaks, and edges of rock, 
are visible far down, until the eye is lost in the depths of 
darkness.&nbsp; But the greatest beauty of the spring is the splendid 
colouring proceeding from the rock; it is of the tenderest, most 
transparent, pale blue and green, and resembles the reflection of a Bengal 
flame.&nbsp; But what is most strange is, that this play of colour proceeds
from the rock, and only extends eight to ten inches from it, while the 
other water is colourless as common water, only more transparent, and 
purer.</p>
<p>I could not believe it at first, and thought it must be occasioned by 
the sun; I therefore visited the springs at different times, sometimes when
the sun shone brightly, sometimes when it was obscured by clouds, once even
after its setting; but the colouring always remained the same.</p>
<p>One may fearlessly approach the brink of these springs.&nbsp; The 
platform which projects directly from them, and under which one can see in 
all directions, is indeed only a thin ledge of rock, but strong enough to 
prevent any accident.&nbsp; The beauty consists, as I have said, in the 
magical illumination, and in the transparency, by which all the caves and 
grottoes to the greatest depths become visible to the eye.&nbsp; 
Involuntarily I thought of Schiller&rsquo;s <i>Diver</i>. <a 
name="citation40"></a><a href="#footnote40" class="citation">[40]</a>&nbsp;
I seemed to see the goblet hang on the peaks and jags of the rock; I could 
fancy I saw the monsters rise from the bottom.&nbsp; It must be a peculiar 
pleasure to read this splendid poem in such an appropriate spot.</p>
<p>I found scarcely any basins of Brodem or coloured waters.&nbsp; The only
one of the kind which I saw was a small basin, in which a brownish-red 
substance, rather denser than water, was boiling.&nbsp; Another smaller 
spring, with dirty brown water, I should have quite overlooked, if I had 
not so industriously searched for these curiosities.</p>
<p>At last, after long waiting, on the second day of my stay, on the 27th 
June, at half-past eight in the morning, I was destined to see an eruption 
of the Geyser in its greatest perfection.&nbsp; The peasant, who came daily
in the morning and in the evening to inquire whether I had already seen an 
eruption, was with me when the hollow sounds which precede it were again 
heard.&nbsp; We hastened out, and I again despaired of seeing any thing; 
the water only overflowed as usual, and the sound was already 
ceasing.&nbsp; But all at once, when the last sounds had scarcely died 
away, the explosion began.&nbsp; Words fail me when I try to describe it: 
such a magnificent and overpowering sight can only be seen once in a 
lifetime.</p>
<p>All my expectations and suppositions were far surpassed.&nbsp; The water
spouted upwards with indescribable force and bulk; one pillar rose higher 
than the other; each seemed to emulate the other.&nbsp; When I had in some 
measure recovered from the surprise, and regained composure, I looked at 
the tent.&nbsp; How little, how dwarfish it seemed as compared to the 
height of these pillars of water!&nbsp; And yet it was about twenty feet 
high.&nbsp; It did, indeed, lie ten feet lower than the basin of the 
Geyser; but if tent had been raised above tent, these ten feet could only 
be deducted once, and I calculated, though my calculation may not be 
correct, that one would need to pile up five or six tents to have the 
height of one of the pillars.&nbsp; Without exaggeration, I think the 
largest spout rose above one hundred feet high, and was three to four feet 
in diameter.</p>
<p>Fortunately I had looked at my watch at the beginning of the hollow 
sounds, the forerunners of the eruption, for during its continuance I 
should probably have forgotten to do so.&nbsp; The whole lasted four 
minutes, of which the greater half must have been taken up by the eruption 
itself.</p>
<p>When this wonderful scene was over, the peasant accompanied me to the 
basin.&nbsp; We could now approach it and the boiler without danger, and 
examine both at leisure.&nbsp; There was now nothing to fear; the water had
entirely disappeared from the outer basin.&nbsp; We entered it and 
approached the inner basin, in which the water had sunk seven or eight 
feet, where it boiled and bubbled fiercely.</p>
<p>With a hammer I broke some crust out of the outer as well as out of the 
inner basin; the former was white, the latter brown.&nbsp; I also tasted 
the water; it had not an unpleasant taste, and can only contain an 
inconsiderable proportion of sulphur, as the steam does not even smell of 
it.</p>
<p>I went to the basin of the Geyser every half hour to observe how much 
time was required to fill it again.&nbsp; After an hour I could still 
descend into the outer basin; but half an hour later the inner basin was 
already full, and commenced to overflow.&nbsp; As long as the water only 
filled the inner basin it boiled violently; but the higher it rose in the 
outer one, the less it boiled, and nearly ceased when the basin was filled:
it only threw little bubbles here and there.</p>
<p>After a lapse of two hours&mdash;it was just noon&mdash;the basin was 
filled nearly to the brim; and while I stood beside it the water began 
again to bubble violently, and to emit the hollow sounds.&nbsp; I had 
scarcely time to retreat, for the pillars of water rose immediately.&nbsp; 
This time they spouted during the noise, and were more bulky than those of 
the first explosion, which might proceed from their not rising so high, and
therefore remaining more compact.&nbsp; Their height may have been from 
forty to fifty feet.&nbsp; The basins this time remained nearly as full 
after the eruption as before.</p>
<p>I had now seen two eruptions of the Geyser, and felt amply compensated 
for my persevering patience and watchfulness.&nbsp; But I was destined to 
be more fortunate, and to experience its explosions in all their 
variety.&nbsp; The spring spouted again at seven o&rsquo;clock in the 
evening, ascended higher than at noon, and brought up some stones, which 
looked like black spots and points in the white frothy water-column.&nbsp; 
And during the third night it presented itself under another phase: the 
water rose in dreadful, quickly-succeeding waves, without throwing rays; 
the basin overflowed violently, and generated such a mass of steam as is 
rarely seen.&nbsp; The wind accidentally blew it to the spot where I stood,
and it enveloped me so closely that I could scarcely see a few feet 
off.&nbsp; But I perceived neither smell nor oppression, merely a slight 
degree of warmth.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">June 28th.</p>
<p>As I had now seen the Geyser play so often and so beautifully, I ordered
my horses for nine o&rsquo;clock this morning, to continue my 
journey.&nbsp; I made the more haste to leave, as a Dutch prince was 
expected, who had lately arrived at Reikjavik, with a large retinue, in a 
splendid man-of-war.</p>
<p>I had the luck to see another eruption before my departure at half-past 
eight o&rsquo;clock; and this one was nearly as beautiful as the 
first.&nbsp; This time also the outer basin was entirely emptied, and the 
inner one to a depth of six or seven feet.&nbsp; I could therefore again 
descend into the basin, and bid farewell to the Geyser at the very brink of
the crater, which, of course, I did.</p>
<p>I had now been three nights and two days in the immediate vicinity of 
the Geyser, and had witnessed five eruptions, of which two were of the most
considerable that had ever been known.&nbsp; But I can assure my readers 
that I did not find every thing as I had anticipated it according to the 
descriptions and accounts I had read.&nbsp; I never heard a greater noise 
than I have mentioned, and never felt any trembling of the earth, although 
I paid the greatest attention to every little circumstance, and held my 
head to the ground during an eruption.</p>
<p>It is singular how many people repeat every thing they hear from 
others&mdash;how some, with an over-excited imagination, seem to see, hear,
and feel things which do not exist; and how others, again, tell the most 
unblushing falsehoods.&nbsp; I met an example of this in Reikjavik, in the 
house of the apothecary M&ouml;ller, in the person of an officer of a 
French frigate, who asserted that he had &ldquo;ridden to the very edge of 
the crater of Mount Vesuvius.&rdquo;&nbsp; He probably did not anticipate 
meeting any one in Reikjavik who had also been to the crater of 
Vesuvius.&nbsp; Nothing irritates me so much as such falsehoods and 
boastings; and I could not therefore resist asking him how he had managed 
that feat.&nbsp; I told him that I had been there, and feared danger as 
little as he could do; but that I had been compelled to descend from my 
donkey near the top of the mountain, and let my feet carry me the remainder
of the journey.&nbsp; He seemed rather embarrassed, and pretended he had 
meant to say <i>nearly</i> to the crater; but I feel convinced he will tell
this story so often that he will at last believe it himself.</p>
<p>I hope I do not weary my readers by dwelling so long on the subject of 
the Geyser.&nbsp; I will now vary the subject by relating a few 
circumstances that came under my notice, which, though trifling in 
themselves, were yet very significant.&nbsp; The most unimportant facts of 
an almost unknown country are often interesting, and are often most 
conclusive evidences of the general character of the nation.</p>
<p>I have already spoken of my intoxicated guide.&nbsp; It is yet 
inexplicable to me how he could have conducted me so safely in such a 
semi-conscious state; and had he not been the only one, I should certainly 
not have trusted myself to his guidance.</p>
<p>Of the want of cleanliness of the Icelanders, no one who has not 
witnessed it can have any idea; and if I attempted to describe some of 
their nauseous habits, I might fill volumes.&nbsp; They seem to have no 
feeling of propriety, and I must, in this respect, rank them as far 
inferior to the Bedouins and Arabs&mdash;even to the Greenlanders.&nbsp; I 
can, therefore, not conceive how this nation could once have been 
distinguished for wealth, bravery, and civilisation.</p>
<p>On this day I proceeded on my journey about twenty-eight miles farther 
to Skalholt.</p>
<p>For the first five miles we retraced our former road; then we turned to 
the left and traversed the beautiful long valley in which the Geyser is 
situated.&nbsp; For many miles we could see its clouds of steam rising to 
the sky.&nbsp; The roads were tolerable only when they passed along the 
sides of hills and mountains; in the plains they were generally marshy and 
full of water.&nbsp; We sometimes lost all traces of a road, and only 
pushed on towards the quarter in which the place of our destination was 
situated; and feared withal to sink at every pace into the soft and 
unresisting soil.</p>
<p>I found the indolence of the Icelandic peasants quite 
unpardonable.&nbsp; All the valleys through which we passed were large 
morasses richly overgrown with grass.&nbsp; If the single parishes would 
unite to dig trenches and drain the soil, they would have the finest 
meadows.&nbsp; This is proved near the many precipices where the water has 
an outlet; in these spots the grass grows most luxuriantly, and daisies and
herbs flourish there, and even wild clover.&nbsp; A few cottages are 
generally congregated on these oases.</p>
<p>Before arriving at the village of Thorfast&auml;dir, we already 
perceived Hecla surrounded by the beautiful jokuls.</p>
<p>I arrived at Thorfast&auml;dir while a funeral was going on.&nbsp; As I 
entered the church the mourners were busily seeking courage and consolation
in the brandy-bottle.&nbsp; The law commands, indeed, that this be not done
in the church; but if every one obeyed the law, what need would there be of
judges?&nbsp; The Icelanders must think so, else they would discontinue the
unseemly practice.</p>
<p>When the priest came, a psalm or a prayer&mdash;I could not tell which 
it was, being Icelandic&mdash;was so earnestly shouted by peasants under 
the leadership of the priest and elders, that the good people waxed quite 
warm and out of breath.&nbsp; Then the priest placed himself before the 
coffin, which, for want of room, had been laid on the backs of the seats, 
and with a very loud voice read a prayer which lasted more than half an 
hour.&nbsp; With this the ceremony within the church was concluded, and the
coffin was carried round the church to the grave, followed by the priest 
and the rest of the company.&nbsp; This grave was deeper than any I had 
ever seen.&nbsp; When the coffin had been lowered, the priest threw three 
handfuls of earth upon it, but none of the mourners followed his 
example.&nbsp; Among the earth which had been dug out of the grave I 
noticed four skulls, several human bones, and a board of a former 
coffin.&nbsp; These were all thrown in again upon the coffin, and the grave
filled in presence of the priest and the people.&nbsp; One man trod the 
soil firm, then a little mound was made and covered with grass-plots which 
were lying ready.&nbsp; The whole business was completed with miraculous 
speed.</p>
<p>The little town of Skalholt, my station this night, was once as 
celebrated in religious matters as Thingvalla had been politically 
famous.&nbsp; Here, soon after the introduction of Christianity, the first 
bishopric was founded in 1098, and the church is said to have been one of 
the largest and richest.&nbsp; Now Skalholt is a miserable place, and 
consists of three or four cottages, and a wretched wooden church, which may
perhaps contain a hundred persons; it has not even its own priest, but 
belongs to Thorfast&auml;dir.</p>
<p>My first business on arriving was to inspect the yet remaining relics of
past ages.&nbsp; First I was shewn an oil-picture which hangs in the 
church, and is said to represent the first bishop of Skalholt, Thorlakur, 
who was worshipped almost as a saint for his strict and pious life.</p>
<p>After this, preparations were made to clear away the steps of the altar 
and several boards of the flooring.&nbsp; I stood expectantly looking on, 
thinking that I should now have to descend into a vault to inspect the 
embalmed body of the bishop.&nbsp; I must confess this prospect was not the
most agreeable, when I thought of the approaching night which I should have
to spend in this church, perhaps immediately over the grave of the old 
skeleton.&nbsp; I had besides already had too much to do with the dead for 
one day, and could not rid myself of the unpleasant grave-odour which I had
imbibed in Thorfast&auml;dir, and which seemed to cling to my dress and my 
nose. <a name="citation41"></a><a href="#footnote41" 
class="citation">[41]</a>&nbsp; I was therefore not a little pleased when, 
instead of the dreaded vault and mummy, I was only shewn a marble slab, on 
which were inscribed the usual notifications of the birth, death, &amp;c. 
of this great bishop.&nbsp; Besides this, I saw an old embroidered stole 
and a simple golden chalice, both of which are said to be relics of the age
of Thorlakar.</p>
<p>Then we ascended into the so-called store-room, which is only separated 
from the lower portion of the church by a few boards, and which extends to 
the altar.&nbsp; Here are kept the bells and the organ, if the church 
possesses one, the provisions, and a variety of tools.&nbsp; They opened an
immense chest for me there, which seemed to contain only large pieces of 
tallow made in the form of cheeses; but under this tallow I found the 
library, where I discovered an interesting treasure.&nbsp; This was, 
besides several very old books in the Icelandic tongue, three thick folio 
volumes, which I could read very easily; they were German, and contained 
Luther&rsquo;s doctrines, letters, epistles, &amp;c.</p>
<p>I had now seen all there was to be seen, and began to satisfy my 
physical wants by calling for some hot water to make coffee, &amp;c.&nbsp; 
As usual, all the inhabitants of the place ranged themselves in and before 
the church, probably to increase their knowledge of the human race by 
studying my peculiarities.&nbsp; I soon, however, closed the door, and 
prepared a splendid couch for myself.&nbsp; At my first entrance into the 
church, I had noticed a long box, quite filled with sheep&rsquo;s 
wool.&nbsp; I threw my rugs over this, and slept as comfortably as in the 
softest bed.&nbsp; In the morning I carefully teased the wool up again, and
no one could then have imagined where I had passed the night.</p>
<p>Nothing amused me more, when I had lodgings of this description, than 
the curiosity of the people, who would rush in every morning, as soon as I 
opened the door.&nbsp; The first thing they said to each other was always, 
&ldquo;Krar hefur hun sovid&rdquo; (Where can she have slept?).&nbsp; The 
good people could not conceive how it was possible to spend a night 
<i>alone</i> in a church surrounded by a churchyard; they perhaps 
considered me an evil spirit or a witch, and would too gladly have 
ascertained how such a creature slept.&nbsp; When I saw their disappointed 
faces, I had to turn away not to laugh at them.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">June 29th.</p>
<p>Early the next morning I continued my journey.&nbsp; Not far from 
Skalholt we came to the river Thiorsa, which is deep and rapid.&nbsp; We 
crossed in a boat; but the horses had to swim after us.&nbsp; It is often 
very troublesome to make the horses enter these streams; they see at once 
that they will have to swim.&nbsp; The guide and boatmen cannot leave the 
shore till the horses have been forced into the stream; and even then they 
have to throw stones, to threaten them with the whip, and to frighten them 
by shouts and cries, to prevent them from returning.</p>
<p>When we had made nearly twelve miles on marshy roads, we came to the 
beautiful waterfall of the Huitha.&nbsp; This fall is not so remarkable for
its height, which is scarcely more than fifteen to twenty feet, as for its 
breadth, and for its quantity of water.&nbsp; Some beautiful rocks are so 
placed at the ledge of the fall, that they divide it into three parts; but 
it unites again immediately beneath them.&nbsp; The bed of the river, as 
well as its shores, is of lava.</p>
<p>The colour of the water is also a remarkable feature in this river; it 
inclines so much to milky white, that, when the sun shines on it, it 
requires no very strong imaginative power to take the whole for milk.</p>
<p>Nearly a mile above the fall we had to cross the Huitha, one of the 
largest rivers in Iceland.&nbsp; Thence the road lies through meadows, 
which are less marshy than the former ones, till it comes to a broad stream
of lava, which announces the vicinity of the fearful volcano of Hecla.</p>
<p>I had hitherto not passed over such an expanse of country in Iceland as 
that from the Geyser to this place without coming upon streams of 
lava.&nbsp; And this lava-stream seemed to have felt some pity for the 
beautiful meadows, for it frequently separated into two branches, and thus 
enclosed the verdant plain.&nbsp; But it could not withstand the violence 
of the succeeding masses; it had been carried on, and had spread death and 
destruction everywhere.&nbsp; The road to it, through plains covered with 
dark sand, and over steep hills intervening, was very fatiguing and 
laborious.</p>
<p>We proceeded to the little village of Struvellir, where we stopped to 
give our horses a few hours&rsquo; rest.&nbsp; Here we found a large 
assembly of men and animals. <a name="citation42"></a><a href="#footnote42"
class="citation">[42]</a>&nbsp; It happened to be Sunday, and a warm sunny 
day, and so a very full service was held in the pretty little church.&nbsp;
When it was over, I witnessed an amusing rural scene.&nbsp; The people 
poured out of the church,&mdash;I counted ninety-six, which is an 
extraordinarily numerous assemblage for Iceland,&mdash;formed into little 
groups, chatting and joking, not forgetting, however, to moisten their 
throats with brandy, of which they had taken care to bring an ample 
supply.&nbsp; Then they bridled their horses and prepared for departure; 
now the kisses poured in from all sides, and there was no end of 
leave-taking, for the poor people do not know whether they shall ever meet 
again, and when.</p>
<p>In all Iceland welcome and farewell is expressed by a loud kiss,&mdash;a
practice not very delightful for a non-Icelander, when one considers their 
ugly, dirty faces, the snuffy noses of the old people, and the filthy 
little children.&nbsp; But the Icelanders do not mind this.&nbsp; They all 
kissed the priest, and the priest kissed them; and then they kissed each 
other, till the kissing seemed to have no end.&nbsp; Rank is not considered
in this ceremony; and I was not a little surprised to see how my guide, a 
common farm-labourer, kissed the six daughters of a judge, or the wife and 
children of a priest, or a judge and the priest themselves, and how they 
returned the compliment without reserve.&nbsp; Every country has its 
peculiar customs!</p>
<p>The religious ceremonies generally begin about noon, and last two or 
three hours.&nbsp; There being no public inn in which to assemble, and no 
stable in which the horses can be fastened, all flock to the open space in 
front of the church, which thus becomes a very animated spot.&nbsp; All 
have to remain in the open air.</p>
<p>When the service was over, I visited the priest, Herr Horfuson; he was 
kind enough to conduct me to the S&auml;lsun, nine miles distant, 
principally to engage a guide to Hecla for me.</p>
<p>I was doubly rejoiced to have this good man at my side, as we had to 
cross a dangerous stream, which was very rapid, and so deep that the water 
rose to the horses&rsquo; breasts.&nbsp; Although we raised our feet as 
high as possible, we were yet thoroughly wet.&nbsp; This wading across 
rivers is one of the most unpleasant modes of travelling.&nbsp; The horse 
swims more than it walks, and this creates a most disagreeable sensation; 
one does not know whither to direct one&rsquo;s eyes; to look into the 
stream would excite giddiness, and the sight of the shore is not much 
better, for that seems to move and to recede, because the horse, by the 
current, is forced a little way down the river.&nbsp; To my great comfort 
the priest rode by my side to hold me, in case I should not be able to keep
my seat.&nbsp; I passed fortunately through this probation; and when we 
reached the other shore, Herr Horfuson pointed out to me how far the 
current had carried us down the river.</p>
<p>The valley in which S&auml;lsun and the Hecla are situated is one of 
those which are found only in Iceland.&nbsp; It contains the greatest 
contrasts.&nbsp; Here are charming fields covered with a rich green carpet 
of softest grass, and there again hills of black, shining lava; even the 
fertile plains are traversed by streams of lava and spots of sand.&nbsp; 
Mount Hecla notoriously has the blackest lava and the blackest sand; and it
may be imagined how the country looks in its immediate neighbourhood.&nbsp;
One hill only to the left of Hecla is reddish brown, and covered with sand 
and stones of a similar colour.&nbsp; The centre is much depressed, and 
seems to form a large crater.&nbsp; Mount Hecla is directly united with the
lava-mountains piled round it, and seems from the plain only as a higher 
point.&nbsp; It is surrounded by several glaciers, whose dazzling fields of
snow descend far down, and whose brilliant plains have probably never been 
trod by human feet; several of its sides were also covered with snow.&nbsp;
To the left of the valley near S&auml;lsun, and at the foot of a lava-hill,
lies a lovely lake, on whose shores a numerous flock of sheep were 
grazing.&nbsp; Near it rises another beautiful hill, so solitary and 
isolated, that it looks as if it had been cast out by its neighbours and 
banished hither.&nbsp; Indeed, the whole landscape here is so peculiarly 
Icelandic, so strange and remarkable, that it will ever remain impressed on
my memory.</p>
<p>S&auml;lsun lies at the foot of Mount Hecla, but is not seen before one 
reaches it.</p>
<p>Arrived at S&auml;lsun, our first care was to seek a guide, and to 
bargain for every thing requisite for the ascension of the mountain.&nbsp; 
The guide was to procure a horse for me, and to take me and my former guide
to the summit of Hecla.&nbsp; He demanded five thaler and two marks (about 
fifteen shillings), a most exorbitant sum, on which he could live for a 
month.&nbsp; But what could we do?&nbsp; He knew very well that there was 
no other guide to be had, and so I was forced to acquiesce.&nbsp; When all 
was arranged, my kind companion left me, wishing me success on my arduous 
expedition.</p>
<p>I now looked out for a place in which I could spend the night, and a 
filthy hole fell to my lot.&nbsp; A bench, rather shorter that my body, was
put into it, to serve as my bed; beside it hung a decayed fish, which had 
infected the whole room with its smell.&nbsp; I could scarcely breathe; and
as there was no other outlet, I was obliged to open the door, and thus 
receive the visits of the numerous and amiable inhabitants.&nbsp; What a 
strengthening and invigorating preparation for the morrow&rsquo;s 
expedition!</p>
<p>At the foot of Mount Hecla, and especially in this village, every thing 
seems to be undermined.&nbsp; Nowhere, not even on Mount Vesuvius, had I 
heard such hollow, droning sounds as here,&mdash;the echoes of the heavy 
footsteps of the peasants.&nbsp; These sounds made a very awful impression 
on me as I lay all night alone in that dark hole.</p>
<p>My Hecla guide, as I shall call him to distinguish him from my other 
guide, advised me to start at two o&rsquo;clock in the morning, to which I 
assented, well knowing, however, that we should not have mounted our horses
before five o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>As I had anticipated, so it happened.&nbsp; At half-past five we were 
quite prepared and ready for departure.&nbsp; Besides bread and cheese, a 
bottle of water for myself, and one of brandy for my guides, we were also 
provided with long sticks, tipped with iron points to sound the depth of 
the snow, and to lean upon.</p>
<p>We were favoured by a fine warm sunny morning, and galloped briskly over
the fields and the adjoining plains of sand.&nbsp; My guide considered the 
fine weather a very lucky omen, and told me that M. Geimard, the 
before-mentioned French scholar, had been compelled to wait three days for 
fine weather.&nbsp; Nine years had elapsed, and no one had ascended the 
mountain since then.&nbsp; A prince of Denmark, who travelled through 
Iceland some years before, had been there, but had returned without 
effecting his purpose.</p>
<p>Our road at first led us through beautiful fields, and then over plains 
of black sand enclosed on all sides by streams, hillocks, and mountains of 
piled-up lava.&nbsp; Closer and closer these fearful masses approach, and 
scarcely permit a passage through a narrow cleft; we had to climb over 
blocks and hills of lava, where it is difficult to find a firm 
resting-place for the foot.&nbsp; The lava rolled beside and behind us, and
we had to proceed carefully not to fall or be hit by the rolling 
lava.&nbsp; But most dangerous were the chasms filled with snow over which 
we had to pass; the snow had been softened by the warmth of the season, so 
that we sank into it nearly every step, or, what was worse, slipped back 
more than we had advanced.&nbsp; I scarcely think there can be another 
mountain whose ascent offers so many difficulties.</p>
<p>After a labour of about three hours and a half we neared the summit of 
the mountain, where we were obliged to leave our horses.&nbsp; I should, 
indeed, have preferred to do so long before, as I was apprehensive of the 
poor animals falling as they climbed over these precipices&mdash;one might 
almost call them rolling mountains&mdash;but my guide would not permit 
it.&nbsp; Sometimes we came to spots where they were useful, and then he 
maintained that I must ride as far as possible to reserve my strength for 
the remaining difficulties.&nbsp; And he was right; I scarcely believe I 
should have been able to go through it on foot, for when I thought we were 
near the top, hills of lava again rose between us, and we seemed farther 
from our journey&rsquo;s end than before.</p>
<p>My guide told me that he had never taken any one so far on horseback, 
and I can believe it.&nbsp; Walking was bad enough&mdash;riding was 
fearful.</p>
<p>At every fresh declivity new scenes of deserted, melancholy districts 
were revealed to us; every thing was cold and dead, every where there was 
black burnt lava.&nbsp; It was a painful feeling to see so much, and behold
nothing but a stony desert, an immeasurable chaos.</p>
<p>There were still two declivities before us,&mdash;the last, but the 
worst.&nbsp; We had to climb steep masses of lava, sharp and pointed, which
covered the whole side of the mountain.&nbsp; I do not know how often I 
fell and cut my hands on the jagged points of the lava.&nbsp; It was a 
fearful journey!</p>
<p>The dazzling whiteness of the snow contrasted with the bright black lava
beside it had an almost blinding effect.&nbsp; When crossing fields of snow
I did not look at the lava; for having tried to do so once or twice, I 
could not see my way afterwards, and had nearly grown snow-blind.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p164b.jpg">
<img alt="Hecla" src="images/p164s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>After two hours&rsquo; more labour we reached the summit of the 
mountain.&nbsp; I stood now on Mount Hecla, and eagerly sought the crater 
on the snowless top, but did not find it.&nbsp; I was the more surprised, 
as I had read detailed accounts of it in several descriptions of 
travel.</p>
<p>I traversed the whole summit of the mountain and climbed to the 
adjoining jokul, but did not perceive an opening, a fissure, a depressed 
space, nor any sign of a crater.&nbsp; Lower down in the sides of the 
mountain, but not in the real cone, I saw some clefts and fissures from 
which the streams of lava probably poured.&nbsp; The height of the mountain
is said to be 4300 feet.</p>
<p>During the last hour of our ascent the sun had grown dim.&nbsp; Clouds 
of mist blown from the neighbouring glaciers enshrouded the hill-tops, and 
soon enveloped us so closely that we could scarcely see ten paces before 
us.&nbsp; At last they dissolved, fortunately not in rain but in snow, 
which profusely covered the black uneven lava.&nbsp; The snow remained on 
the ground, and the thermometer stood at one degree of cold.</p>
<p>In a little while the clear blue sky once more was visible, and the sun 
again shone over us.&nbsp; I remained on the top till the clouds had 
separated beneath us, and afforded me a better distant view over the 
country.</p>
<p>My pen is unfortunately too feeble to bring vividly before my readers 
the picture such as I beheld it here, and to describe to them the 
desolation, the extent and height of these lava-masses.&nbsp; I seemed to 
stand in a crater, and the whole country appeared only a burnt-out 
fire.&nbsp; Here lava was piled up in steep inaccessible mountains; there 
stony rivers, whose length and breadth seemed immeasurable, filled the 
once-verdant fields.&nbsp; Every thing was jumbled together, and yet the 
course of the last eruption could be distinctly traced.</p>
<p>I stood there, in the centre of horrible precipices, caves, streams, 
valleys, and mountains, and scarcely comprehended how it was possible to 
penetrate so far, and was overcome with terror at the thought which 
involuntarily obtruded itself&mdash;the possibility of never finding my way
again out of these terrible labyrinths.</p>
<p>Here, from the top of Mount Hecla, I could see far into the uninhabited 
country, the picture of a petrified creation, dead and motionless, and yet 
magnificent,&mdash;a picture which once seen can never again fade from the 
memory, and which alone amply compensates for all the previous troubles and
dangers.&nbsp; A whole world of glaciers, lava-mountains, snow and 
ice-fields, rivers and lakes, into which no human foot has ever ventured to
penetrate.&nbsp; How nature must have laboured and raged till these forms 
were created!&nbsp; And is it over now?&nbsp; Has the destroying element 
exhausted itself; or does it only rest, like the hundred-headed Hydra, to 
break forth with renewed strength, and desolate those regions which, pushed
to the verge of the sea-shore, encircle the sterile interior as a modest 
wreath?&nbsp; I thank God that he has permitted me to behold this chaos in 
his creation; but I thank him more heartily that he has placed me to dwell 
in regions where the sun does more than merely give light; where it 
inspires and fertilises animals and plants, and fills the human heart with 
joy and thankfulness towards its Creator. <a name="citation43"></a><a 
href="#footnote43" class="citation">[43]</a></p>
<p>The Westmann Isles, which are said to be visible from the top of Hecla, 
I could not see; they were probably covered by clouds.</p>
<p>During the ascent of the Hecla I had frequently touched 
lava,&mdash;sometimes involuntarily, when I fell; sometimes voluntarily, to
find a hot or at least a warm place.&nbsp; I was unfortunate enough only to
find cold ones.&nbsp; The falling snow was therefore most welcome, and I 
looked anxiously around to see a place where the subterranean heat would 
melt it.&nbsp; I should then have hastened thither and found what I 
sought.&nbsp; But unfortunately the snow remained unmelted every 
where.&nbsp; I could neither see any clouds of smoke, although I gazed 
steadily at the mountain for hours, and could from my post survey it far 
down the sides.</p>
<p>As we descended we found the snow melting at a depth of 500 to 600 feet;
lower down, the whole mountain smoked, which I thought was the consequence 
of the returning warmth of the sun, for my thermometer now stood at nine 
degrees of heat.&nbsp; I have noticed the same circumstance often on 
unvolcanic mountains.&nbsp; The spots from which the smoke rose were also 
cold.</p>
<p>The smooth jet-black, bright, and dense lava is only found on the 
mountain itself and in its immediate vicinity.&nbsp; But all lava is not 
the same: there is jagged, glassy, and porous lava; the former is black, 
and so is the sand which covers one side of Hecla.&nbsp; The farther the 
lava and sand are from the mountain, the more they lose this blackness, and
their colour plays into iron-colour and even into light-grey; but the 
lighter-coloured lava generally retains the brightness and smoothness of 
the black lava.</p>
<p>After a troublesome descent, having spent twelve hours on this 
excursion, we arrived safely at S&auml;lsun; and I was on the point of 
returning to my lodging, somewhat annoyed at the prospect of spending 
another night in such a hole, when my guide surprised me agreeably by the 
proposition to return to Struvellir at once.&nbsp; The horses, he said, 
were sufficiently rested, and I could get a good room there in the 
priest&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; I soon packed, and in a short time we were 
again on horseback.&nbsp; The second time I came to the deep Rangaa, I rode
across fearlessly, and needed no protection at any side.&nbsp; Such is man:
danger only alarms him the first time; when he has safely surmounted it 
once, he scarcely thinks of it the second time, and wonders how he can have
felt any fear.</p>
<p>I saw five little trees standing in a field near the stream.&nbsp; The 
stems of these, which, considering the scarcity of trees in Iceland, may be
called remarkable phenomena, were crooked and knotty, but yet six or seven 
feet high, and about four or five inches in diameter.</p>
<p>As my guide had foretold, I found a very comfortable room and a good bed
in the priest&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; Herr Horfuson is one of the best men I 
have ever met with.&nbsp; He eagerly sought opportunities for giving me 
pleasure, and to him I owe several fine minerals and an Icelandic book of 
the year 1601.&nbsp; May God reward his kindness and benevolence!</p>
<p style="text-align: right">July 1st.</p>
<p>We retraced our steps as far as the river Huitha, over which we rowed, 
and then turned in another direction.&nbsp; Our journey led us through 
beautiful valleys, many of them producing abundance of grass; but 
unfortunately so much moss grew among it, that these large plains were not 
available for pastures, and only afforded comfort to travellers by their 
aspect of cheerfulness.&nbsp; They were quite dry.</p>
<p>The valley in which Hjalmholm, our resting-place for this night, was 
situated, is traversed by a stream of lava, which had, however, been modest
enough not to fill up the whole valley, but to leave a space for the pretty
stream Elvas, and for some fields and hillocks, on which many cottages 
stood.&nbsp; It was one of the most populous valleys I had seen in 
Iceland.</p>
<p>Hjalmholm is situated on a hill.&nbsp; In it lives the Sysselmann of the
Rangaar district, in a large and beautiful house such as I saw no where in 
Iceland except in Reikjavik.&nbsp; He had gone to the capital of the island
as member of the Allthing; but his daughters received me very hospitably 
and kindly.</p>
<p>We talked and chatted much; I tried to display my knowledge of the 
Danish language before them, and must often have made use of curious 
phrases, for the girls could not contain their laughter.&nbsp; But that did
not abash me; I laughed with them, applied to my dictionary, which I 
carried with me, and chatted on.&nbsp; They seemed to gather no very high 
idea of the beauty of my countrywomen from my personal appearance; for 
which I humbly crave the forgiveness of my countrywomen, assuring them that
no one regrets the fact more than I do.&nbsp; But dame Nature always treats
people of my years very harshly, and sets a bad example to youth of the 
respect due to age.&nbsp; Instead of honouring us and giving us the 
preference, she patronises the young folks, and every maiden of sixteen can
turn up her nose at us venerable matrons.&nbsp; Besides my natural 
disqualifications, the sharp air and the violent storms to which I had been
subjected had disfigured my face very much.&nbsp; They had affected me more
than the burning heat of the East.&nbsp; I was very brown, my lips were 
cracked, and my nose, alas, even began to rebel against its ugly 
colour.&nbsp; It seemed anxious to possess a new, dazzling white, tender 
skin, and was casting off the old one in little bits.</p>
<p>The only circumstance which reinstated me in the good opinion of the 
young girls was, that having brushed my hair unusually far out of my face, 
a white space became visible.&nbsp; The girls all cried out simultaneously,
quite surprised and delighted: &ldquo;Hun er quit&rdquo; (she is 
white).&nbsp; I could not refrain from laughing, and bared my arm to prove 
to them that I did not belong to the Arab race.</p>
<p>A great surprise was destined me in this house; for, as I was ransacking
the Sysselmann&rsquo;s book-case, I found Rotteck&rsquo;s Universal 
History, a German Lexicon, and several poems and writings of German 
poets.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">July 2d.</p>
<p>The way from Kalmannstunga to Thingvalla leads over nothing but lava, 
and the one to-day went entirely through marshes.&nbsp; As soon as we had 
crossed one, another was before us.&nbsp; Lava seemed to form the soil 
here, for little portions of this mineral rose like islands out of the 
marshes.</p>
<p>The country already grew more open, and we gradually lost sight of the 
glaciers.&nbsp; The high mountains on the left seemed like hills in the 
distance, and the nearer ones were really hills.&nbsp; After riding about 
nine miles we crossed the large stream of Elvas in a boat, and then had to 
tread carefully across a very long, narrow bank, over a meadow which was 
quite under water.&nbsp; If a traveller had met us on this bank, I do not 
know what we should have done; to turn round would have been as dangerous 
as to sink into the morass.&nbsp; Fortunately one never meets any 
travellers in Iceland.</p>
<p>Beyond the dyke the road runs for some miles along the mountains and 
hills, which all consist of lava, and are of a very dark, nearly black 
colour.&nbsp; The stones on these hills were very loose; in the plain below
many colossal pieces were lying, which must have fallen down; and many 
others threatened to fall every moment.&nbsp; We passed the dangerous spot 
safely, without having had to witness such a scene.</p>
<p>I often heard a hollow sound among these hills; I at first took it for 
distant thunder, and examined the horizon to discover the approaching 
storm.&nbsp; But when I saw neither clouds nor lightning, I perceived that 
I must seek the origin of the sounds nearer, and that they proceeded from 
the falling portions of rock.</p>
<p>The higher mountains to the left fade gradually more and more from view;
but the river Elvas spreads in such a manner, and divides into so many 
branches, that one might mistake it for a lake with many islands.&nbsp; It 
flows into the neighbouring sea, whose expanse becomes visible after 
surmounting a few more small hills.</p>
<p>The vale of Reikum, which we now entered, is, like that of Reikholt, 
rich in hot springs, which are congregated partly in the plain, partly on 
or behind the hills, in a circumference of between two and three miles.</p>
<p>When we had reached the village of Reikum I sent my effects at once to 
the little church, took a guide, and proceeded to the boiling 
springs.&nbsp; I found very many, but only two remarkable ones; these, 
however, belong to the most noteworthy of their kind.&nbsp; The one is 
called the little Geyser, the other the Bogensprung.</p>
<p>The little Geyser has an inner basin of about three feet diameter.&nbsp;
The water boils violently at a depth of from two to three feet, and remains
within its bounds till it begins to spout, when it projects a beautiful 
voluminous steam of from 20 to 30 feet high.</p>
<p>At half-past eight in the evening I had the good fortune to see one of 
these eruptions, and needed not, as I had done at the great Geyser, to 
bivouac near it for days and nights.&nbsp; The eruption lasted some time, 
and was tolerably equable; only sometimes the column of water sank a 
little, to rise to its former height with renewed force.&nbsp; After forty 
minutes it fell quite down into the basin again.&nbsp; The stones we threw 
in, it rejected at once, or in a few seconds, shivered into pieces, to a 
height of about 12 to 15 feet.&nbsp; Its bulk must have been 1 to 1&frac12;
feet in diameter.&nbsp; My guide assured me that this spring generally 
plays only twice, rarely thrice, in twenty-four hours, and not, as I have 
seen it stated, every six minutes.&nbsp; I remained near it till midnight, 
but saw no other eruption.</p>
<p>This spring very much resembles the Strukker near the great Geyser, the 
only difference being that the water sinks much lower in the latter.</p>
<p>The second of the two remarkable springs, the arched spring, is situated
near the little Geyser, on the declivity of a hill.&nbsp; I had never seen 
such a curious formation for the bed of a spring as this is.&nbsp; It has 
no basin, but lies half open at your feet, in a little grotto, which is 
separated into various cavities and holes, and which is half-surrounded by 
a wall of rock bending over it slightly at a height of about 2 feet, and 
then rises 10 to 12 feet higher.&nbsp; This spring never is at rest more 
than a minute; then it begins to rise and boil quickly, and emits a 
voluminous column, which, striking against the projecting rock, is 
flattened by it, and rises thence like an arched fan.&nbsp; The height of 
this peculiarly-spread jet of water may be about 12 feet, the arch it 
describes 15 to 20 feet, and its breadth 3 to 8 feet.&nbsp; The time of 
eruption is often longer than that of repose.&nbsp; After an eruption the 
water always sinks a few feet into the cave, and for 15 or 20 seconds 
admits of a glance into this wonderful grotto.&nbsp; But it rises again 
immediately, fills the grotto and the basin, which is only a continuation 
of the grotto, and springs again.</p>
<p>I watched this miraculous play of nature for more than an hour, and 
could not tear myself from it.&nbsp; This spring, which is certainly the 
only one of its kind, gratified me much more than the little Geyser.</p>
<p>There is another spring called the roaring Geyser; but it is nothing 
more than a misshapen hole, in which one hears the water boil, but cannot 
see it.&nbsp; The noise is, also, not at all considerable.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">July 3d.</p>
<p>Near Reikum we crossed a brook into which all the hot springs flow, and 
which has a pretty fall.&nbsp; We then ascended the adjoining mountain, and
rode full two hours on the high plain.&nbsp; The plain itself was 
monotonous, as it was only covered with lava-stones and moss, but the 
prospect into the valley was varied and beautiful.&nbsp; Vale and sea were 
spread before me, and I saw the Westmann Islands, with their beautiful 
hills, which the envious clouds had concealed from me on the Hecla, lying 
in the distance.&nbsp; Below me stood some houses in the port-town, 
Eierbach, and near them the waters of the Elvas flow into the sea.</p>
<p>At the end of this mountain-level a valley was situated, which was also 
filled with lava, but with that jagged black lava which presents such a 
beautiful appearance.&nbsp; Immense streams crossed it from all sides, so 
that it almost resembled a black lake separated from the sea by a chain of 
equally black mountains.</p>
<p>We descended into this sombre vale through piles of lava and fields of 
snow, and went on through valleys and chasms, over fields of lava, plains 
of meadow-land, past dark mountains and hills, till we reached the chief 
station of my Icelandic journey, the town of Reikjavik.</p>
<p>The whole country between Reikum and Reikjavik, a distance of 45 to 50 
miles, is, for the most part, uninhabited.&nbsp; Here and there, in the 
fields of lava, stand little pyramids of the same substance, which serve as
landmarks; and there are two houses built for such persons as are obliged 
to travel during the winter.&nbsp; But we found much traffic on the road, 
and often overtook caravans of 15 to 20 horses.&nbsp; Being the beginning 
of August, it was the time of trade and traffic in Iceland.&nbsp; Then the 
country people travel to Reikjavik from considerable distances, to change 
their produce and manufactures, partly for money, partly for necessaries 
and luxuries.&nbsp; At this period the merchants and factors have not hands
enough to barter the goods or close the accounts which the peasants wish to
settle for the whole year.</p>
<p>At this season an unusual commotion reigns in Reikjavik.&nbsp; Numerous 
groups of men and horses fill the streets; goods are loaded and unloaded; 
friends who have not met for a year or more welcome each other, others take
leave.&nbsp; On one spot curious tents <a name="citation44"></a><a 
href="#footnote44" class="citation">[44]</a> are erected, before which 
children play; on another drunken men stagger along, or gallop on 
horseback, so that one is terrified, and fears every moment to see them 
fall.</p>
<p>This unusual traffic unfortunately only lasts six or eight days.&nbsp; 
The peasant hastens home to his hay-harvest; the merchant must quickly 
regulate the produce and manufactures he has purchased, and load his ships 
with them, so that they may sail and reach their destination before the 
storms of the autumnal equinox.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<p>During my travels in Iceland I had of course the opportunity of becoming
acquainted with its inhabitants, their manners and customs.&nbsp; I must 
confess that I had formed a higher estimate of the peasants.&nbsp; When we 
read in the history of that country that the first inhabitants had 
emigrated thither from civilised states; that they had brought knowledge 
and religion with them; when we hear of the simple good-hearted people, and
their patriarchal mode of life in the accounts of former travellers, and 
which we know that nearly every peasant in Iceland can read and write, and 
that at least a Bible, but generally other religions books also, are found 
in every cot,&mdash;one feels inclined to consider this nation the best and
most civilised in Europe.&nbsp; I deemed their morality sufficiently 
secured by the absence of foreign intercourse, by their isolated position, 
and the poverty of the country.&nbsp; No large town there affords 
opportunity for pomp or gaiety, or for the commission of smaller or greater
sins.&nbsp; Rarely does a foreigner enter the island, whose remoteness, 
severe climate, inhospitality, and poverty, are uninviting.&nbsp; The 
grandeur and peculiarity of its natural formation alone makes it 
interesting, and that does not suffice for the masses.</p>
<p>I therefore expected to find Iceland a real Arcadia in regard to its 
inhabitants, and rejoiced at the anticipation of seeing such an Idyllic 
life realised.&nbsp; I felt so happy when I set foot on the island that I 
could have embraced humanity.&nbsp; But I was soon undeceived.</p>
<p>I have often been impatient at my want of enthusiasm, which must be 
great, as I see every thing in a more prosaic form than other 
travellers.&nbsp; I do not maintain that my view is <i>right</i>, but I at 
least possess the virtue of describing facts as I see them, and do not 
repeat them from the accounts of others.</p>
<p>I have already described the impoliteness and heartlessness of the 
so-called higher classes, and soon lost the good opinion I had formed of 
them.&nbsp; I now came to the working classes in the vicinity of 
Reikjavik.&nbsp; The saying often applied to the Swiss people, &ldquo;No 
money, no Swiss,&rdquo; one may also apply to the Icelanders.&nbsp; And of 
this fact I can cite several examples.</p>
<p>Scarcely had they heard that I, a foreigner, had arrived, than they 
frequently came to me, and brought quite common objects, such as can be 
found any where in Iceland, and expected me to pay dearly for them.&nbsp; 
At first I purchased from charity, or to be rid of their importunities, and
threw the things away again; but I was soon obliged to give this up, as I 
should else have been besieged from morning to night.&nbsp; Their anxiety 
to gain money without labour annoyed me less than the extortionate prices 
with which they tried to impose on a stranger.&nbsp; For a beetle, such as 
could be found under every stone, they asked 5 kr. (about 2d.); as much for
a caterpillar, of which thousands were lying on the beach; and for a common
bird&rsquo;s egg, 10 to 20 kr. (4d. to 8d.)&nbsp; Of course, when I 
declined buying, they reduced their demand, sometimes to less than half the
original sum; but this was certainly not in consequence of their 
honesty.&nbsp; The baker in whose house I lodged also experienced the 
selfishness of these people.&nbsp; He had engaged a poor labourer to tar 
his house, who, when he had half finished his task, heard of other 
employment.&nbsp; He did not even take the trouble to ask the baker to 
excuse him for a few days; he went away, and did not return to finish the 
interrupted work for a whole week.&nbsp; This conduct was the more 
inexcusable as his children received bread, and even butter, twice a week 
from the baker.</p>
<p>I was fortunate enough to experience similar treatment.&nbsp; Herr 
Knudson had engaged a guide for me, with whom I was to take my departure in
a few days.&nbsp; But it happened that the magistrate wished also to take a
trip, and sent for my guide.&nbsp; The latter expected to be better paid by
him, and went; he did not come to me to discharge himself, but merely sent 
me word on the eve of my departure, that he was ill, and could therefore 
not go with me.&nbsp; I could enumerate many more such examples, which do 
not much tend to give a high estimate of Icelandic morality.</p>
<p>I consoled myself with the hope of finding simplicity and honesty in the
more retired districts, and therefore anticipated a twofold pleasure from 
my journey into the interior.&nbsp; I found many virtues, but unfortunately
so many faults, that I am no longer inclined to exalt the Icelandic 
peasants as examples.</p>
<p>The best of their virtues is their honesty.&nbsp; I could leave my 
baggage unguarded any where for hours, and never missed the least article, 
for they did not even permit their children to touch any thing.&nbsp; In 
this point they are so conscientious, that if a peasant comes from a 
distance, and wishes to rest in a cottage, he never fails to knock at the 
door, even if it is open.&nbsp; If no one calls &ldquo;come in,&rdquo; he 
does not enter.&nbsp; One might fearlessly sleep with open doors.</p>
<p>Crimes are of such rare occurrence here, that the prison of Reikjavik 
was changed into a dwelling-house for the chief warden many years 
since.&nbsp; Small crimes are punished summarily, either in Reikjavik or at
the seat of the Sysselmann.&nbsp; Criminals of a deeper dye are sent to 
Copenhagen, and are sentenced and punished there.</p>
<p>My landlord at Reikjavik, the master-baker Bernh&ouml;ft, told me that 
only one crime had been committed in Iceland during the thirteen years that
he had resided there.&nbsp; This was the murder of an illegitimate child 
immediately after its birth.&nbsp; The most frequently occurring crime is 
cow-stealing.</p>
<p>I was much surprised to find that nearly all the Icelanders can read and
write.&nbsp; The latter quality only was somewhat rarer with the 
women.&nbsp; Youths and men often wrote a firm, good hand.&nbsp; I also 
found books in every cottage, the Bible always, and frequently poems and 
stories, sometimes even in the Danish language.</p>
<p>They also comprehend very quickly; when I opened my map before them, 
they soon understood its use and application.&nbsp; Their quickness is 
doubly surprising, if we consider that every father instructs his own 
children, and sometimes the neighbouring orphans.&nbsp; This is of course 
only done in the winter; but as winter lasts eight months in Iceland, it is
long enough.</p>
<p>There is only one school in the whole island, which originally was in 
Bessestadt, but has been removed to Reikjavik since 1846.&nbsp; In this 
school only youths who can read and write are received, and they are either
educated for priests, and may complete their studies here, or for doctors, 
apothecaries, or judges, when they must complete their studies in 
Copenhagen.</p>
<p>Besides theology, geometry, geography, history, and several languages, 
such as Latin, Danish, and, since 1846, German and also French, are taught 
in the school of Reikjavik.</p>
<p>The chief occupation of the Icelandic peasants consists in fishing, 
which is most industriously pursued in February, March, and April.&nbsp; 
Then the inhabitants of the interior come to the coasting villages and hire
themselves to the dwellers on the beach, the real fishermen, as assistants,
taking a portion of the fish as their wages.&nbsp; Fishing is attended to 
at other times also, but then exclusively by the real fishermen.&nbsp; In 
the months of July and August many of the latter go into the interior and 
assist in the hay-harvest, for which they receive butter, sheep&rsquo;s 
wool, and salt lamb.&nbsp; Others ascend the mountains and gather the 
Iceland moss, of which they make a decoction, which they drink mixed with 
milk, or they grind it to flour, and bake flat cakes of it, which serve 
them in place of bread.</p>
<p>The work of the women consists in the preparation of the fish for 
drying, smoking, or salting; in tending the cattle, in knitting, sometimes 
in gathering moss.&nbsp; In winter both men and women knit and weave.</p>
<p>As regards the hospitality of the Icelanders, <a 
name="citation45"></a><a href="#footnote45" class="citation">[45]</a> I do 
not think one can give them so very much credit for it.&nbsp; It is true 
that priests and peasants gladly receive any European traveller, and treat 
him to every thing in their power; but they know well that the traveller 
who comes to their island is neither an adventurer nor a beggar, and will 
therefore pay them well.&nbsp; I did not meet one peasant or priest who did
not accept the proffered gift without hesitation.&nbsp; But I must say of 
the priests that they were every where obliging and ready to serve me, and 
satisfied with the smallest gift; and their charges, when I required horses
for my excursions, were always moderate.&nbsp; I only found the peasant 
less interested in districts where a traveller scarcely ever appeared; but 
in such places as were more visited, their charges were often 
exorbitant.&nbsp; For example, I had to pay 20 to 30 kr. (8d. to 1s.) for 
being ferried over a river; and then my guide and I only were rowed in the 
boat, and the horses had to swim.&nbsp; The guide who accompanied me on the
Hecla also overcharged me; but he knew that I was forced to take him, as 
there is no choice of guides, and one does not give up the ascent for the 
sake of a little money.</p>
<p>This conduct shows that the character of the Icelanders does not belong 
to the best; and that they take advantage of travellers with as much 
shrewdness as the landlords and guides on the continent.</p>
<p>A besetting sin of the Icelanders is their drunkenness.&nbsp; Their 
poverty would probably not be so great if they were less devoted to brandy,
and worked more industriously.&nbsp; It is dreadful to see what deep root 
this vice has taken.&nbsp; Not only on Sundays, but also on week-days, I 
met peasants who were so intoxicated that I was surprised how they could 
keep in their saddle.&nbsp; I am, however, happy to say that I never saw a 
woman in this degrading condition.</p>
<p>Another of their passions is snuff.&nbsp; They chew and snuff tobacco 
with the same infatuation as it is smoked in other countries.&nbsp; But 
their mode of taking it is very peculiar.&nbsp; Most of the peasants, and 
even many of the priests, have no proper snuff-box, but only a box turned 
of bone, shaped like a powder-flask.&nbsp; When they take snuff, they throw
back their head, insert the point of the flask in their nose, and shake a 
dose of tobacco into it.&nbsp; They then, with the greatest amiability, 
offer it to their neighbour, he to his, and so it goes round till it 
reaches the owner again.</p>
<p>I think, indeed, that the Icelanders are second to no nation in 
uncleanliness; not even to the Greenlanders, Esquimaux, or 
Laplanders.&nbsp; If I were to describe a portion only of what I 
experienced, my readers would think me guilty of gross exaggeration; I 
prefer, therefore, to leave it to their imagination; merely saying that 
they cannot conceive any thing too dirty for Iceland delicacy.</p>
<p>Beside this very estimable quality, they are also insuperably 
lazy.&nbsp; Not far from the coast are immense meadows, so marshy that it 
is dangerous to cross them.&nbsp; The fault lies less in the soil than the 
people.&nbsp; If they would only make ditches, and thus dry the ground, 
they would have the most splendid grass.&nbsp; That this would grow 
abundantly is proved by the little elevations which rise from above the 
marshes, and which are thickly covered with grass, herbage, and wild 
clover.&nbsp; I also passed large districts covered with good soil, and 
some where the soil was mixed with sand.</p>
<p>I frequently debated with Herr Boge, who has lived in Iceland for forty 
years, and is well versed in farming matters, whether it would not be 
possible to produce important pasture-grounds and hay-fields with industry 
and perseverance.&nbsp; He agreed with me, and thought that even 
potato-fields might be reclaimed, if only the people were not so lazy, 
preferring to suffer hunger and resign all the comforts of cleanliness 
rather than to work.&nbsp; What nature voluntarily gives, they are 
satisfied with, and it never occurs to them to force more from her.&nbsp; 
If a few German peasants were transported hither, what a different 
appearance the country would soon have!</p>
<p>The best soil in Iceland is on the Norderland.&nbsp; There are a few 
potato-grounds there, and some little trees, which, without any 
cultivation, have reached a height of seven to eight feet.&nbsp; Herr Boge,
established here for thirty years, had planted some mountain-ash and 
birch-trees, which had grown to a height of sixteen feet.</p>
<p>In the Norderland, and every where except on the coast, the people live 
by breeding cattle.&nbsp; Many a peasant there possesses from two to four 
hundred sheep, ten to fifteen cows, and ten to twelve horses.&nbsp; There 
are not many who are so rich, but at all events they are better off than 
the inhabitants of the sea-coast.&nbsp; The soil there is for the most part
bad, and they are therefore nearly all compelled to have recourse to 
fishing.</p>
<p>Before quitting Iceland, I must relate a tradition told me by many 
Icelanders, not only by peasants, but also by people of the so-called 
higher classes, and who all implicitly believe it.</p>
<p>It is asserted that the inhospitable interior is likewise populated, but
by a peculiar race of men, to whom alone the paths through these deserts 
are known.&nbsp; These savages have no intercourse with their 
fellow-countrymen during the whole year, and only come to one of the ports 
in the beginning of July, for one day at the utmost, to buy several 
necessaries, for which they pay in money.&nbsp; They then vanish suddenly, 
and no one knows in which direction they are gone.&nbsp; No one knows them;
they never bring their wives or children with them, and never reply to the 
question whence they come.&nbsp; Their language, also, is said to be more 
difficult than that of the other inhabitants of Iceland.</p>
<p>One gentleman, whom I do not wish to name, expressed a wish to have the 
command of twenty to twenty-five well-armed soldiers, to search for these 
wild men.</p>
<p>The people who maintain that they have seen these children of nature, 
assert that they are taller and stronger than other Icelanders; that their 
horses&rsquo; hoofs, instead of being shod earth iron, have shoes of horn; 
and that they have much money, which they can only have acquired by 
pillage.&nbsp; When I inquired what respectable inhabitants of Iceland had 
been robbed by these savages, and when and where, no one could give me an 
answer.&nbsp; For my part, I scarcely think that one man, certainly not a 
whole race, could live by pillage in Iceland.</p>
<h3>DEPARTURE FROM ICELAND.&mdash;JOURNEY TO COPENHAGEN.</h3>
<p>I had seen all there was to be seen in Iceland, had finished all my 
excursions, and awaited with inexpressible impatience the sailing of the 
vessel which was destined to bring me nearer my beloved home.&nbsp; But I 
had to stay four very long weeks in Reikjavik, my patience being more 
exhausted from day to day, and had after this long delay to be satisfied 
with the most wretched accommodation.</p>
<p>The delay was the more tantalising, as several ships left the port in 
the mean time, and Herr Knudson, with whom I had crossed over from 
Copenhagen, invited me to accompany him on his return; but all the vessels 
went to England or to Spain, and I did not wish to visit either of these 
countries.&nbsp; I was waiting for an opportunity to go to Scandinavia, to 
have at least a glance at these picturesque districts.</p>
<p>At last there were two sloops which intended to sail towards the end of 
July.&nbsp; The better of the two went to Altona; the destination of the 
other was Copenhagen.&nbsp; I had intended to travel in the former; but a 
merchant of Reikjavik had already engaged the only berth,&mdash;for there 
rarely is more than one in such a small vessel,&mdash;and I deemed myself 
lucky to obtain the one in the other ship.&nbsp; Herr Bernh&ouml;ft 
thought, indeed, that the vessel might be too bad for such a long journey, 
and proposed to examine it, and report on its condition.&nbsp; But as I had
quite determined to go to Denmark, I requested him to waive the 
examination, and agree with the captain about my passage.&nbsp; If, as I 
anticipated, he found the vessel too wretched, his warnings might have 
shaken my resolution, and I wished to avoid that contingency.</p>
<p>We heard, soon, that a young Danish girl, who had been in service in 
Iceland, wished to return by the same vessel.&nbsp; She had been suffering 
so much from home-sickness, that she was determined, under any 
circumstances, to see her beloved fatherland again.&nbsp; If, thought I to 
myself, the home-sickness is powerful enough to make this girl indifferent 
to the danger, longing must take its place in my breast and effect the same
result.</p>
<p>Our sloop bore the consolatory name of Haabet (hope), and belonged to 
the merchant Fromm, in Copenhagen.</p>
<p>Our departure had been fixed for the 26th of July, and after that day I 
scarcely dared to leave my house, being in constant expectation of a 
summons on board.&nbsp; Violent storms unfortunately prevented our 
departure, and I was not called till the 29th of July, when I had to bid 
farewell to Iceland.</p>
<p>This was comparatively easy.&nbsp; Although I had seen many wonderful 
views, many new and interesting natural phenomena, I yet longed for my 
accustomed fields, in which we do not find magnificent and overpowering 
scenes, but lovelier and more cheerful ones.&nbsp; The separation from Herr
Knudson and the family of Bernh&ouml;ft was more difficult.&nbsp; I owed 
all the kindness I had experienced in the island, every good advice and 
useful assistance in my travels, only to them.&nbsp; My gratitude to these 
kind and good people will not easily fade from my heart.</p>
<p>At noon I was already on board, and had leisure to admire all the gay 
flags and streamers with which the French frigate anchoring here had been 
decked, to celebrate the anniversary of the July revolution.</p>
<p>I endeavoured to turn my attention as much as possible to exterior 
objects, and not to look at our ship, for all that I had involuntarily seen
had not impressed me very favourably.&nbsp; I determined also not to enter 
the cabin till we were in the open sea and the pilots had left our sloop, 
so that all possibility of return would be gone.</p>
<p>Our crew consisted of captain, steersman, two sailors, and a cabin-boy, 
who bore the title of cook; we added that of valet, as he was appointed to 
wait on us.</p>
<p>When the pilots had left us, I sought the entrance of the 
cabin,&mdash;the only, and therefore the common apartment.&nbsp; It 
consisted of a hole two feet broad, which gaped at my feet, and in which a 
perpendicular ladder of five steps was inserted.&nbsp; I stood before it 
puzzled to know which would be the best mode of descent, but knew no other 
way than to ask our host the captain.&nbsp; He shewed it me at once, by 
sitting at the entrance and letting his feet down.&nbsp; Let the reader 
imagine such a proceeding with our long dresses, and, above all, in bad 
weather, when the ship was pitched about by storms.&nbsp; But the thought 
that many other people are worse off, and can get on, was always the anchor
of consolation to which I held; I argued with myself that I was made of the
same stuff as other human beings, only spoiled and pampered, but that I 
could bear what they bore.&nbsp; In consequence of this self-arguing, I sat
down at once, tried the new sliding-ladder, and arrived below in 
safety.</p>
<p>I had first to accustom my eyes to the darkness which reigned here, the 
hatches being constructed to admit the light very sparingly.&nbsp; I soon, 
however, saw too much; for all was raggedness, dirt, and disorder.&nbsp; 
But I will describe matters in the order in which they occurred to me; for,
as I flatter myself that many of my countrywomen will in spirit make this 
journey with me, and as many of them probably never had the opportunity of 
being in such a vessel, I wish to describe it to them very 
accurately.&nbsp; All who are accustomed to the sea will testify that I 
have adhered strictly to the truth.&nbsp; But to return to the sloop.&nbsp;
Its age emulated mine, she being a relic of the last century.&nbsp; At that
time little regard was paid to the convenience of passengers, and the space
was all made available for freight; a fact which cannot surprise us, as the
seaman&rsquo;s life is passed on deck, and the ship was not built for 
travellers.&nbsp; The entire length of the cabin from one berth to the 
other was ten feet; the breadth was six feet.&nbsp; The latter space was 
made still narrower by a box on one side, and by a little table and two 
little seats on the other, so that only sufficient space remained to pass 
through.</p>
<p>At dinner or supper, the ladies&mdash;the Danish girl and 
myself&mdash;sat on the little benches, where we were so squeezed, that we 
could scarcely move; the two cavaliers&mdash;the captain and the 
steersman&mdash;were obliged to stand before the table, and eat their meals
in that position.&nbsp; The table was so small that they were obliged to 
hold their plates in their hands.&nbsp; In short, every thing shewed the 
cabin was made only for the crew, not for the passengers.</p>
<p>The air in this enclosure was also not of the purest; for, besides that 
it formed our bed-room, dining-room, and drawing-room, it was also used as 
store-room, for in the side cupboards provisions of various kinds were 
stored, also oil-colours, and a variety of other matter.&nbsp; I preferred 
to sit on the deck, exposed to the cold and the storm, or to be bathed by a
wave, than to be half stifled below.&nbsp; Sometimes, however, I was 
obliged to descend, either when rain and storms were too violent, or when 
the ship was so tossed by contrary winds that the deck was not safe.&nbsp; 
The rolling and pitching of our little vessel was often so terrible, that 
we ladies could neither sit nor stand, and were therefore obliged to lie 
down in the miserable berths for many a weary day.&nbsp; How I envied my 
companion! she could sleep day and night, which I could not.&nbsp; I was 
nearly always awake, much to my discomfort; for the hatches and the 
entrance were closed during the storm, and an Egyptian darkness, as well as
a stifling atmosphere, filled the cabin.</p>
<p>In regard to food, all passengers, captain and crew, ate of the same 
dish.&nbsp; The morning meal consisted of miserable tea, or rather of 
nauseous water having the colour of tea.&nbsp; The sailors imbibed theirs 
without sugar, but the captain and the steersman took a small piece of 
candied sugar, which does not melt so quickly as the refined sugar, in 
their mouth, and poured down cup after cup of tea, and ate ship&rsquo;s 
biscuit and butter to it.</p>
<p>The dinner fare varied.&nbsp; The first day we had salt meat, which is 
soaked the evening before, and boiled the next day in sea-water.&nbsp; It 
was so salt, so hard, and so tough, that only a sailor&rsquo;s palate can 
possibly enjoy it.&nbsp; Instead of soup, vegetables, and pudding, we had 
pearl-barley boiled in water, without salt or butter; to which treacle and 
vinegar was added at the dinner-table.&nbsp; All the others considered this
a delicacy, and marvelled at my depraved taste when I declared it to be 
unpalatable.</p>
<p>The second day brought a piece of bacon, boiled in sea-water, with the 
barley repeated.&nbsp; On the third we had cod-fish with peas.&nbsp; 
Although the latter were boiled hard and without butter, they were the most
eatable of all the dishes.&nbsp; On the fourth day the bill of fare of the 
first was repeated, and the same course followed again.&nbsp; At the end of
every dinner we had black coffee.&nbsp; The supper was like the 
breakfast,&mdash;tea-water, ship&rsquo;s biscuit and butter.</p>
<p>I wished to have provided myself with some chickens, eggs, and potatoes 
in Reikjavik, but I could not obtain any of these luxuries.&nbsp; Very few 
chickens are kept&mdash;only the higher officials or merchants have them; 
eggs of eider-ducks and other birds may often be had, but more are never 
collected than are wanted for the daily supply, and then only in spring; 
for potatoes the season was not advanced enough.&nbsp; My readers have now 
a picture of the luxurious life I led on board the ship.&nbsp; Had I been 
fortunate enough to voyage in a better vessel, where the passengers are 
more commodiously lodged and better fed, the seasickness would certainly 
not have attacked me; but in consequence of the stifling atmosphere of the 
cabin and the bad food, I suffered from it the first day.&nbsp; But on the 
second I was well again, regained my appetite, and ate salt meat, bacon, 
and peas as well as a sailor; the stockfish, the barley, and the coffee and
tea, I left untouched.</p>
<p>A real sailor never drinks water; and this observation of mine was 
confirmed by our captain and steersman: instead of beer or wine, they took 
tea, and, except at meals, cold tea.</p>
<p>On Sunday evenings we had a grand supper, for the captain had eight 
eggs, which he had brought from Denmark, boiled for us four people.&nbsp; 
The crew had a few glasses of punch-essence mixed in their tea.</p>
<p>As my readers are now acquainted with the varied bill of fare in such a 
ship, I will say a few words of the table-linen.&nbsp; This consisted only 
of an old sailcloth, which was spread over the table, and looked so dirty 
and greasy that I thought it would be much better and more agreeable to 
leave the table uncovered.&nbsp; But I soon repented the unwise thought, 
and discovered how important this cloth was.&nbsp; One morning I saw our 
valet treating a piece of sailcloth quite outrageously: he had spread it 
upon the deck, stood upon it, and brushed it clean with the ship&rsquo;s 
broom.&nbsp; I recognised our tablecloth by the many spots of dirt and 
grease, and in the evening found the table bare.&nbsp; But what was the 
consequence?&nbsp; Scarcely had the tea-pot been placed on the table than 
it began to slip off; had not the watchful captain quickly caught it, it 
would have fallen to the ground and bathed our feet with its 
contents.&nbsp; Nothing could stand on the polished table, and I sincerely 
pitied the captain that he had not another tablecloth.</p>
<p>My readers will imagine that what I have described would have been quite
sufficient to make my stay in the vessel any thing but agreeable; but I 
discovered another circumstance, which even made it alarming.&nbsp; This 
was nothing less than that our little vessel was constantly letting in a 
considerable quantity of water, which had to be pumped out every few 
hours.&nbsp; The captain tried to allay my uneasiness by asserting that 
every ship admitted water, and ours only leaked a little more because it 
was so old.&nbsp; I was obliged to be content with his explanation, as it 
was now too late to think of a change.&nbsp; Fortunately we did not meet 
with any storms, and therefore incurred less danger.</p>
<p>Our journey lasted twenty days, during twelve of which we saw no land; 
the wind drove us too far east to see the Feroe or the Shetland 
Isles.&nbsp; I should have cared less for this, had I seen some of the 
monsters of the deep instead, but we met with scarcely any of these amiable
animals.&nbsp; I saw the ray of water which a whale emitted from his 
nostrils, and which exactly resembled a fountain; the animal itself was 
unfortunately too far from our ship for us to see its body.&nbsp; A shark 
came a little nearer; it swam round our vessel for a few moments, so that I
could easily look at him: it must have been from sixteen to eighteen feet 
long.</p>
<p>The so-called flying-fish afforded a pretty sight.&nbsp; The sea was as 
calm as a mirror, the evening mild and moonlight; and so we remained on 
deck till late, watching the gambols of these animals.&nbsp; As far as we 
could see, the water was covered with them.&nbsp; We could recognise the 
younger fishes by their higher springs; they seemed to be three to four 
feet long, and rose five to six feet above the surface of the sea.&nbsp; 
Their leaping looked like an attempt at flying, but their gills did not do 
them good service in the trial, and they fell back immediately.&nbsp; The 
old fish did not seem to have the same elasticity; they only described a 
small arch like the dolphins, and only rose so far above the water that we 
could see the middle part of their body.</p>
<p>These fish are not caught; they have little oil, and an unpleasant 
taste.</p>
<p>On the thirteenth day we again saw land.&nbsp; We had entered the 
Skagerrak, and saw the peninsula of J&uuml;tland, with the town of 
Skaggen.&nbsp; The peninsula looks very dreary from this side; it is flat 
and covered with sand.</p>
<p>On the sixteenth day we entered the Cattegat.&nbsp; For some time past 
we had always either been becalmed or had had contrary winds, and had been 
tossed about in the Skagerrak, the Cattegat, and the Sound for nearly a 
week.&nbsp; On some days we scarcely made fifteen to twenty leagues a 
day.&nbsp; On such calm days I passed the time with fishing; but the fish 
were wise enough not to bite my hook.&nbsp; I was daily anticipating a 
dinner of mackerel, but caught only one.</p>
<p>The multitude of vessels sailing into the Cattegat afforded me more 
amusement; I counted above seventy.&nbsp; The nearer we approached the 
entrance of the Sound, the more imposing was the sight, and the more 
closely were the vessels crowded together.&nbsp; Fortunately we were 
favoured by a bright moonlight; in a dark or stormy night we should not 
with the greatest precaution and skill have been able to avoid a 
collision.</p>
<p>The inhabitants of more southern regions have no idea of the 
extraordinary clearness and brilliancy of a northern moonlight night; it 
seems almost as if the moon had borrowed a portion of the sun&rsquo;s 
lustre.&nbsp; I have seen splendid nights on the coast of Asia, on the 
Mediterranean; but here, on the shores of Scandinavia, they were lighter 
and brighter.</p>
<p>I remained on deck all night; for it pleased me to watch the forests of 
masts crowded together here, and endeavouring simultaneously to gain the 
entrance to the Sound.&nbsp; I should now be able to form a tolerable idea 
of a fleet, for this number of ships must surely resemble a 
merchant-fleet.</p>
<p>On the twentieth day of our journey we entered the port of 
Helsing&ouml;r.&nbsp; The Sound dues have to be paid here, or, as the 
sailor calls it, the ship must be cleared.&nbsp; This is a very tedious 
interruption, and the stopping and restarting of the ship very 
incommodious.&nbsp; The sails have to be furled, the anchor cast, the boat 
lowered, and the captain proceeds on shore; hours sometimes elapse before 
he has finished.&nbsp; When he returns to the ship, the boat has to be 
hoisted again, the anchor raised, and the sails unfurled.&nbsp; Sometimes 
the wind has changed in the mean time; and in consequence of these 
formalities, the port of Copenhagen cannot be reached at the expected 
time.</p>
<p>If a ship is unfortunate enough to reach Helsing&ouml;r on a dark night,
she may not enter at all for fear of a collision.&nbsp; She has to anchor 
in the Cattegat, and thus suffer two interruptions.&nbsp; If she arrives at
Helsing&ouml;r in the night before four o&rsquo;clock, she has to wait, as 
the custom-house is not opened till that time.</p>
<p>The skipper is, however, at liberty to proceed direct to Copenhagen, but
this liberty costs five thalers (fifteen shillings).&nbsp; If, however, the
toll may thus be paid in Copenhagen just as easily, the obligation to stop 
at Helsing&ouml;r is only a trick to gain the higher toll; for if a captain
is in haste, or the wind is too favourable to be lost, he forfeits the five
thalers, and sails on to Copenhagen.</p>
<p>Our captain cared neither for time nor trouble; he cleared the ship 
here, and so we did not reach Copenhagen until two o&rsquo;clock in the 
afternoon.&nbsp; After my long absence, it seemed so familiar, so beautiful
and grand, as if I had seen nothing so beautiful in my whole life.&nbsp; My
readers must bear in mind, however, where I came from, and how long I had 
been imprisoned in a vessel in which I scarcely had space to move.&nbsp; 
When I put foot on shore again, I could have imitated Columbus, and 
prostrated myself to kiss the earth.</p>
<h3>DEPARTURE FROM COPENHAGEN.&mdash;CHRISTIANIA.</h3>
<p>On the 19th August, the day after my arrival from Iceland, at two 
o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, I had already embarked again; this time in 
the fine royal Norwegian steamer <i>Christiania</i>, of 170 horsepower, 
bound for the town of Christiania, distant 304 sea-miles from 
Copenhagen.&nbsp; We had soon passed through the Sound and arrived safely 
in the Cattegat, in which we steered more to the right than on the journey 
to Iceland; for we not only intended to see Norway and Sweden, but to cast 
anchor on the coast.</p>
<p>We could plainly see the fine chain of mountains which bound the 
Cattegat on the right, and whose extreme point, the Kulm, runs into the sea
like a long promontory.&nbsp; Lighthouses are erected here, and on the 
other numerous dangerous spots of the coast, and their lights shine all 
around in the dark night.&nbsp; Some of the lights are movable, and some 
stationary, and point out to the sailor which places to avoid.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">August 20th.</p>
<p>Bad weather is one of the greatest torments of a traveller, and is more 
disagreeable when one passes through districts remarkable for beauty and 
originality.&nbsp; Both grievances were united to-day; it rained, almost 
incessantly; and yet the passage of the Swedish coast and of the little 
fiord to the port of Gottenburg was of peculiar interest.&nbsp; The sea 
here was more like a broad stream which is bounded by noble rocks, and 
interspersed by small and large rocks and shoals, over which the waters 
dashed finely.&nbsp; Near the harbour, some buildings lie partly on and 
partly between the rocks; these contain the celebrated royal Swedish 
iron-foundry, called the new foundry.&nbsp; Even numerous American ships 
were lying here to load this metal. <a name="citation46"></a><a 
href="#footnote46" class="citation">[46]</a></p>
<p>The steamer remains more than four hours in the port of Gottenburg, and 
we had therefore time to go into the town, distant about two miles, and 
whose suburbs extend as far as the port.&nbsp; On the landing-quay a 
captain lives who has always a carriage and two horses ready to drive 
travellers into the town.&nbsp; There are also one-horse vehicles, and even
an omnibus.&nbsp; The former were already engaged; the latter, we were 
told, drives so slowly, that nearly the whole time is lost on the road; so 
I and two travelling companions hired the captain&rsquo;s carriage.&nbsp; 
The rain poured in torrents on our heads; but this did not disturb us 
much.&nbsp; My two companions had business to transact, and curiosity 
attracted me.&nbsp; I did not at that time know that I should have occasion
to visit this pretty little town again, and would not leave without seeing 
it.</p>
<p>The suburbs are built entirely of wood, and contain many pretty 
one-story houses, surrounded, for the most part, by little gardens.&nbsp; 
The situation of the suburbs is very peculiar.&nbsp; Rocks, or little 
fields and meadows, often lie between the houses; the rocks even now and 
then cross the streets, and had to be blasted to form a road.&nbsp; The 
view from one of the hills over which the road to the town lies is truly 
beautiful.</p>
<p>The town has two large squares: on the smaller one stands the large 
church; on the larger one the town-hall, the post-office, and many pretty 
houses.&nbsp; In the town every thing is built of bricks.&nbsp; The river 
Ham flows through the large square, and increases the traffic by the many 
ships and barks running into it from the sea, and bringing provisions, but 
principally fuel, to market.&nbsp; Several bridges cross it.&nbsp; A visit 
to the well-stocked fish-market is also an interesting feature in a short 
visit to this town.</p>
<p>I entered a Swedish house for the first time here.&nbsp; I remarked that
the floor was strewed over with the fine points of the fir-trees, which had
an agreeable odour, a more healthy one probably than any artificial 
perfume.&nbsp; I found this custom prevalent all over Sweden and Norway, 
but only in hotels and in the dwellings of the poorer classes.</p>
<p>About eleven o&rsquo;clock in the forenoon we continued our 
journey.&nbsp; We steered safely through the many rocks and shoals, and 
soon reached the open sea again.&nbsp; We did not stand out far from the 
shore, and saw several telegraphs erected on the rocks.&nbsp; We soon lost 
sight of Denmark on the left, and arrived at the fortress Friedrichsver 
towards evening, but could not see much of it.&nbsp; Here the so-called 
Scheren begin, which extend sixty leagues, and form the Christian&rsquo;s 
Sound.&nbsp; By what I could see in the dim twilight, the scene was 
beautiful.&nbsp; Numerous islands, some merely consisting of bare rocks, 
others overgrown with slender pines, surrounded us on all sides.&nbsp; But 
our pilot understood his business perfectly, and steered us safely through 
to Sandesund, spite of the dark night.&nbsp; Here we anchored, for it would
have been too dangerous to proceed.&nbsp; We had to wait here for the 
steamer from Bergen, which exchanged passengers with us.&nbsp; The sea was 
very rough, and this exchange was therefore extremely difficult to 
effect.&nbsp; Neither of the steamers would lower a boat; at last our 
steamer gave way, after midnight, and the terrified and wailing passengers 
were lowered into it.&nbsp; I pitied them from my heart, but fortunately no
accident happened.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">August 21st</p>
<p>I could see the situation of Sandesund better by day; and found it to 
consist only of a few houses.&nbsp; The water is so hemmed in here that it 
scarcely attains the breadth of a stream; but it soon widens again, and 
increases in beauty and variety with every yard.&nbsp; We seemed to ride on
a beautiful lake; for the islands lie so close to the mountains in the 
background, that they look like a continent, and the bays they form like 
the mouths of rivers.&nbsp; The next moment the scene changes to a 
succession of lakes, one coming close on the other; and when the ship 
appears to be hemmed in, a new opening is suddenly presented to the eye 
behind another island.&nbsp; The islands themselves are of a most varied 
character: some only consist of bare rocks, with now and then a pine; some 
are richly covered with fields and groves; and the shore presents so many 
fine scenes, that one hardly knows where to look in order not to miss any 
of the beauties of the scenery.&nbsp; Here are high mountains overgrown 
from the bottom to the summit with dark pine-groves; there again lovely 
hills, with verdant meadows, fertile fields, pretty farmsteads and yards; 
and on another side the mountains separate and form a beautiful perspective
of precipices and valleys.&nbsp; Sometimes I could follow the bend of a bay
till it mingled with the distant clouds; at others we passed the most 
beautiful valleys, dotted with little villages and towns.&nbsp; I cannot 
describe the beauties of the scenery in adequate terms: my words are too 
weak, and my knowledge too insignificant; and I can only give an idea of my
emotions, but not describe them.</p>
<p>Near Walloe the country grows less beautiful; the mountains decrease 
into hills, and the water is not studded with islands.&nbsp; The little 
town itself is almost concealed behind the hills.&nbsp; A remarkable 
feature is the long row of wooden huts and houses adjoining, which all 
belong to a salt-work established there.</p>
<p>We entered one of the many little arms of the sea to reach the town of 
Moss.&nbsp; Its situation is beautiful, being built amphi-theatrically on a
hillock which leans against a high mountain.&nbsp; A fine building on the 
sea-shore, whose portico rests upon pillars, is used for a bathing 
institution.</p>
<p>A dock-yard, in which men-of-war are built at the expense of the state, 
is situated near the town of Horten, which is also picturesquely 
placed.&nbsp; There does not seem to be much work doing here, for I only 
saw one ship lying at anchor, and none on the stocks.&nbsp; About eight 
leagues beyond Horten a mountain rises in the middle of the sea, and 
divides it into two streams, uniting again beyond it, and forming a pretty 
view.</p>
<p>We did not see Christiania till we were only ten leagues from it.&nbsp; 
The town, the suburbs, the fortress, the newly-erected royal palace, the 
freemasons&rsquo; lodge, &amp;c., lie in a semicircle round the port, and 
are bounded by fields, meadows, woods, and hills, forming a delightful 
<i>coup-d&rsquo;oeil</i>.&nbsp; It seems as if the sea could not part from 
such a lovely view, and runs in narrow streams, through hills and plains, 
to a great distance beyond the town.</p>
<p>Towards eleven o&rsquo;clock in the forenoon we reached the port of 
Christiania.&nbsp; We had come from Sandesund in seven hours, and had 
stopped four times on the way; but the boats with new-comers, with 
merchandise and letters, had always been ready, had been received, and we 
had proceeded without any considerable delay.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<p>My first care on arriving in this town was to find a countrywoman of 
mine who had been married to a lawyer here.&nbsp; It is said of the 
Viennese that they cannot live away from their Stephen&rsquo;s steeple; but
here was a proof of the contrary, for there are few couples living so 
happily as these friends, and yet they were nearly one thousand miles from 
St. Stephen&rsquo;s steeple. <a name="citation47"></a><a href="#footnote47"
class="citation">[47]</a></p>
<p>I passed through the whole town on the way from the quay to the hotel, 
and thence to my friend.&nbsp; The town is not large, and not very 
pretty.&nbsp; The newly-built portion is the best, for it at least has 
broad, tolerably long streets, in which the houses are of brick, and 
sometimes large.&nbsp; In the by-streets I frequently found wooden barracks
ready to fall.&nbsp; The square is large, but irregular; and as it is used 
as a general market-place, it is also very dirty.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p196b.jpg">
<img alt="Christiania" src="images/p196s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>In the suburbs the houses are mostly built of wood.&nbsp; There are some
rather pretty public buildings; the finest among them are the royal castle 
and the fortress.&nbsp; They are built on little elevations, and afford a 
beautiful view.&nbsp; The old royal palace is in the town, but not at all 
distinguishable from a common private house.&nbsp; The house in which the 
Storthing <a name="citation48"></a><a href="#footnote48" 
class="citation">[48]</a> assembles is large, and its portico rests on 
pillars; but the steps are of wood, as in all stone houses in 
Scandinavia.&nbsp; The theatre seemed large enough for the population; but 
I did not enter it.&nbsp; The freemasons&rsquo; lodge is one of the most 
beautiful buildings in the town; it contains two large saloons, which are 
used for assemblies or festivities of various kinds, besides serving as the
meeting-place of the freemasons.&nbsp; The university seemed almost too 
richly built; it is not finished yet, but is so beautiful that it would be 
an ornament to the largest capital.&nbsp; The butchers&rsquo; market is 
also very pretty.&nbsp; It is of a semi-circular shape, and is surrounded 
by arched passages, in which the buyers stand, sheltered from the 
weather.&nbsp; The whole edifice is built of bricks, left in their natural 
state, neither stuccoed with mortar nor whitewashed.&nbsp; There are not 
many other palaces or fine public buildings, and most of the houses are 
one-storied.</p>
<p>One of the features of the place&mdash;a custom which is of great use to
the traveller, and prevails in all Scandinavian towns&mdash;is, that the 
names of the streets are affixed at every corner, so that the passer-by 
always knows where he is, without the necessity of asking his way.</p>
<p>Open canals run through the town; and on such nights as the almanac 
announces a full or bright moon the streets are not lighted.</p>
<p>Wooden quays surround the harbour, on which several large warehouses, 
likewise built of wood, are situated; but, like most of the houses, they 
are roofed with tiles.</p>
<p>The arrangement and display of the stores are simple, and the wares very
beautiful, though not of home manufacture.&nbsp; Very few factories exist 
here, and every thing has to be imported.</p>
<p>I was much shocked at the raggedly-clad people I met every where in the 
streets; the young men especially looked very ragged.&nbsp; They rarely 
begged; but I should not have been pleased to meet them alone in a retired 
street.</p>
<p>I was fortunate enough to be in Christiania at the time when the 
Storthing was sitting.&nbsp; This takes place every three years; the 
sessions commence in January or February, and usually last three months; 
but so much business had this time accumulated, that the king proposed to 
extend the length of the session.&nbsp; To this fortunate accident I owed 
the pleasure of witnessing some of the meetings.&nbsp; The king was 
expected to close the proceedings in September. <a name="citation49"></a><a
href="#footnote49" class="citation">[49]</a></p>
<p>The hall of meeting is long and large.&nbsp; Four rows of tapestried 
seats, one rising above the other, run lengthways along the hall, and 
afford room for eighty legislators.&nbsp; Opposite the benches a table 
stands on a raised platform, and at this table the president and secretary 
sit.&nbsp; A gallery, which is open to the public, runs round the upper 
portion of the hall.</p>
<p>Although I understood but little of the Norwegian language, I attended 
the meetings daily for an hour.&nbsp; I could at least distinguish whether 
long or short speeches were made, or whether the orator spoke 
fluently.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the speakers I heard spoke the few words 
they mustered courage to deliver so slowly and hesitatingly, that I could 
not form a very favourable idea of Norwegian eloquence.&nbsp; I was told 
that the Storthing only contained three or four good speakers, and they did
not display their talents during my stay.</p>
<p>I have never seen such a variety of carriages as I met with here.&nbsp; 
The commonest and most incommodious are called Carriols.&nbsp; A carriol 
consists of a narrow, long, open box, resting between two immensely high 
wheels, and provided with a very small seat.&nbsp; You are squeezed into 
this contrivance, and have to stretch your feet forward.&nbsp; You are then
buckled in with a leather apron as high as the hips, and must remain in 
this position, without moving a limb, from the beginning to the end of your
ride.&nbsp; A board is hung on behind the box for the coachman; and from 
this perch he, in a kneeling or standing position, directs the horses, 
unless the temporary resident of the box should prefer to take the reins 
himself.&nbsp; As it is very unpleasant to hear the quivering of the reins 
on one side and the smacking of the whip on the other, every one, men and 
women, can drive.&nbsp; Besides these carriols, there are phaetons, 
droschkas, but no closed vehicles.</p>
<p>The carts which are used for the transport of beer are of a very 
peculiar construction.&nbsp; The consumption of beer in Christiania is very
great, and it is at once bottled when made, and not sold in casks.&nbsp; 
The carts for the transport of these bottles consist of roomy covered boxes
a foot and a half high, which are divided into partitions like a cellaret, 
in which many bottles can be easily and safely transported from one part to
another.</p>
<p>Another species of basket, which the servants use to carry such articles
as are damp or dirty, and which my readers will excuse my describing, is 
made of fine white tin, and provided with a handle.&nbsp; Straw baskets are
only used for bread, and for dry and clean provisions.</p>
<p>There are no public gardens or assemblies in Christiania, but numerous 
promenades; indeed, every road from the town leads to the most beautiful 
scenery, and every hill in the neighbourhood affords the most delightful 
prospects.</p>
<p>Ladegardoen is the only spot which is often resorted to by the citizens 
by carriage or on foot.&nbsp; It affords many and splendid views of the sea
and its islands, of the surrounding mountains, valleys, and pine and fir 
groves.&nbsp; The majority of the country-houses are built here.&nbsp; They
are generally small, but pretty, and surrounded by flower-gardens and 
orchards.&nbsp; While there, I seemed to be far in the south, so green and 
verdant was the scenery.&nbsp; The corn-fields alone betrayed the 
north.&nbsp; Not that the corn was poor; on the contrary, I found many ears
bending to the ground under their weight; but now, towards the end of 
August, most of it was standing uncut in the fields.</p>
<p>Near the town stands a pine-grove, from which one has splendid views; 
two monuments are raised in it, but neither of them are of importance: one 
is raised to the memory of a crown-prince of Sweden, Christian Augustus; 
the other to Count Hermann Wenel Jarlsberg.</p>
<h3>JOURNEY TO DELEMARKEN.</h3>
<p>All I had hitherto seen in Norway had gratified me so much, that I could
not resist the temptation of a journey to the wildly romantic regions of 
Delemarken.&nbsp; I was indeed told that it would be a difficult 
undertaking for a female, alone and almost entirely ignorant of the 
language, to make her way through the peasantry.&nbsp; But I found no one 
to accompany me, and was determined to go; so I trusted to fate, and went 
alone.</p>
<p>According to the inquires I had instituted in respect to this journey, I
anticipated that my greatest difficulties would arise from the absence of 
all institutions for the speedy and comfortable progress of 
travellers.&nbsp; One is forced to possess a carriage, and to hire horses 
at every station.&nbsp; It is sometimes possible to hire a vehicle, but 
this generally consists only of a miserable peasant&rsquo;s cart.&nbsp; I 
hired, therefore, a carriol for the whole journey, and a horse to the next 
station, the townlet of Drammen, distant about twenty-four miles.</p>
<p>On the 25th August, at three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, I left 
Christiania, squeezed myself into my carriage, and, following the example 
of Norwegian dames, I seized the reins.&nbsp; I drove as if I had been used
to it from infancy.&nbsp; I turned right and left, and my horse galloped 
and trotted gaily on.</p>
<p>The road to Drammen is exquisite, and would afford rich subjects for an 
artist.&nbsp; All the beauties of nature are here combined in most perfect 
harmony.&nbsp; The richness and variety of the scenery are almost 
oppressive, and would be an inexhaustible subject for the painter.&nbsp; 
The vegetation is much richer than I had hoped to find it so far north; 
every hill, every rock, is shaded by verdant foliage; the green of the 
meadows was of incomparable freshness; the grass was intermingled with 
flowers and herbs, and the corn-fields bent under their golden weight.</p>
<p>I have been in many countries, and have seen beautiful districts; I have
been in Switzerland, in Tyrol, in Italy, and in Salzburg; but I never saw 
such peculiarly beautiful scenery as I found here: the sea every where 
intruding and following us to Drammen; here forming a lovely lake on which 
boats were rocking, there a stream rushing through hills and meadows; and 
then again, the splendid expanse dotted with proud three-masters and with 
countless islets.&nbsp; After a five hours&rsquo; ride through rich valleys
and splendid groves, I reached the town of Drammen, which lies on the 
shores of the sea and the river Storri Elf, and whose vicinity was 
announced by the beautiful country-houses ornamenting the approach to 
it.</p>
<p>A long, well-built wooden bridge, furnished with beautiful iron 
palisadings, leads over the river.&nbsp; The town of Drammen has pretty 
streets and houses, and above 6000 inhabitants.&nbsp; The hotel where I 
lodged was pretty and clean.&nbsp; My bedroom was a large room, with which 
the most fastidious might have been contented.&nbsp; The supper which they 
provided for me was, however, most frugal, consisting only of soft-boiled 
eggs.&nbsp; They gave me neither salt nor bread with them, nor a spoon; 
nothing but a knife and fork.&nbsp; And it is a mystery to me how soft eggs
can be eaten without bread, and with a knife and fork.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">August 25th.</p>
<p>I hired a fresh horse here, with which I proceeded to Kongsberg, 
eighteen miles farther.&nbsp; The first seven miles afforded a repetition 
of the romantic scenery of the previous day, with the exception of the 
sea.&nbsp; But instead I had the beautiful river, until I had ascended a 
hill, from whose summit I overlooked a large and apparently populous 
valley, filled with groups of houses and single farms.&nbsp; It is strange 
that there are very few large towns in Norway; every peasant builds his 
house in the midst of his fields.</p>
<p>Beyond this hill the scenery grows more monotonous.&nbsp; The mountains 
are lower, the valley narrower, and the road is enclosed by wood or 
rocks.&nbsp; One peculiarity of Norwegian rocks is their humidity.&nbsp; 
The water penetrates through countless fissures, but only in such small 
quantities as to cover the stones with a kind of veil.&nbsp; When the sun 
shines on these wet surfaces of rock, of which there are many and large 
ones, they shine like mirrors.</p>
<p>Delemarken seems to be tolerably populous.&nbsp; I often met with 
solitary peasant-huts in the large gloomy forests, and they gave some life 
to the monotonous landscape.&nbsp; The industry of the Norwegian peasant is
very great; for every spot of earth, even on the steepest precipices, bore 
potatoes, barley, or oats; their houses also look cheerful, and were 
painted for the most part of a brick-red colour.</p>
<p>I found the roads very good, especially the one from Christiania to 
Drammen; and the one from Drammen to Kongsberg was not very 
objectionable.&nbsp; There is such an abundance of wood in Norway, that the
streets on each side are fenced by wooden enclosures; and every field and 
meadow is similarly protected against the intrusion of cattle, and the 
miserable roads through the woods are even covered with round trunks of 
trees.</p>
<p>The peasantry in this district have no peculiar costume; only the 
head-covering of the females is curious.&nbsp; They wear a lady&rsquo;s 
hat, such as was fashionable in the last century, ornamented with a bunch 
behind, and with an immense shade in front.&nbsp; They are made of any 
material, generally of the remains of old garments; and only on Sundays 
better ones, and sometimes even silk ones, make their appearance.</p>
<p>In the neighbourhood of Kongsberg this head-dress is no longer 
worn.&nbsp; There they wear little caps like the Suabian peasantry, 
petticoats commencing under the shoulders, and very short spencers: a very 
ugly costume, the whole figure being spoilt by the short waist.</p>
<p>The town of Kongsberg is rather extended, and is beautifully situated on
a hill in the centre of a splendid wooded valley.&nbsp; It is, like all the
towns in Norway except Christiania, built of wood; but it has many pretty, 
neat houses and some broad streets.</p>
<p>The stream Storri Elf flows past the town, and forms a small but very 
picturesque waterfall a little below the bridge.&nbsp; What pleased me most
was the colour of the water as it surged over the rock.&nbsp; It was about 
noon as I drove across the bridge; the sun illuminated the whole country 
around, and the waves breaking against the rocks seemed by this light of a 
beautiful pale-yellow colour, so that they resembled thick masses of pure 
transparent amber.</p>
<p>Two remarkable sights claimed my attention at Kongsberg,&mdash;a rich 
silver-mine, and a splendid waterfall called the Labrafoss.&nbsp; But as my
time was limited and I could only remain a few hours in Kongsberg, I 
preferred to see the waterfall and believe the accounts of the silver-mine;
which were, that the deepest shaft was eight hundred feet below the 
surface, and that it was most difficult to remain there, as the cold, the 
smoke, and the powder-smell had a very noxious effect on the traveller 
accustomed to light and air.</p>
<p>I therefore hired a horse and drove to the fall, which is situated in a 
narrow pass about four miles from Kongsberg.&nbsp; The river collects in a 
quiet calm basin a little distance above the fall, and then rushes over the
steep precipice with a sudden bound.&nbsp; The considerable depth of the 
fall and the quality of water make it a very imposing sight.&nbsp; This is 
increased by a gigantic rock planted like a wall in the lower basin, and 
opposing its body to the progress of the hurrying waters.&nbsp; The waves 
rebound from the rock, and, collecting in mighty masses, rush over it, 
forming several smaller waterfalls in their course.</p>
<p>I watched it from a high rock, and was nevertheless covered by the spray
to such a degree, that I sometimes could scarcely open my eyes.&nbsp; My 
guide then took me to the lower part of the fall, so that I might have a 
view of it from all sides; and each view seemed different and more 
splendid.&nbsp; I perceived the same yellow transparent colour which I had 
remarked in the fall at Kongsberg in the waters which dashed over the rock 
and were illuminated by the sun.&nbsp; I imagine it arises from the rock, 
which is every where of a brownish-red colour, for the water itself was 
clear and pure.</p>
<p>At four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon I left Kongsberg, and drove to 
Bolkesoe, a distance of eighteen miles.&nbsp; It was by no means a 
beautiful or an agreeable drive; for the road was very bad, and took me 
through passes and valleys, across woods and over steep mountains, while 
the night was dark and unilluminated by the moon.&nbsp; The thought 
involuntarily entered my mind, how easily my guide, who sat close behind me
on the vehicle, could put me out of the world by a gentle blow, and take 
possession of my effects.&nbsp; But I had confidence in the upright 
character of the Norwegians, and drove on quietly, devoting my attention 
entirely to the reins of my little steed, which I had to lead with a sure 
hand over hill and valley, over ruts and stones, and along 
precipices.&nbsp; I heard no sound but the rushing of the mountain-river, 
which leaped, close beside us, over the rocks, and was heard rushing in the
far distance.</p>
<p>We did not arrive at Bolkesoe until ten o&rsquo;clock at night.&nbsp; 
When we stopped before an insignificant-looking peasant&rsquo;s cot, and I 
remembered my Icelandic night-accommodations, whose exterior this 
resembled, my courage failed me; but I was agreeably disappointed when the 
peasant&rsquo;s wife led me up a broad staircase into a large clean chamber
furnished with several good beds, some benches, a table, a box, and an iron
stove.&nbsp; I found equal comforts on all the stations of my journey.</p>
<p>There are no proper hotels or posthouses on the little-frequented 
Norwegian roads; but the wealthy peasants undertake the duties of 
both.&nbsp; I would, however, advise every traveller to provide himself 
with bread and other provisions for the trip; for his peasant-host rarely 
can furnish him with these.&nbsp; His cows are on the hills during the 
summer; fowls are far too great a luxury for him; and his bread is scarcely
eatable: it consists of large round cakes, scarcely half an inch thick, and
very hard; or of equally large cakes scarcely as thick as a knife, and 
quite dry.&nbsp; The only eatables I found were fish and potatoes; and 
whenever I could stay for several hours, they fetched milk for me from the 
hills.</p>
<p>The travelling conveniences are still more unattainable; but these I 
will mention in a future chapter, when my experience will be a little more 
extensive.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">August 26th.</p>
<p>I could not see the situation of the town of Bolkesoe till daylight 
to-day, for when I arrived the darkness of night concealed it.&nbsp; It is 
situated in a pretty wooded vale, on a little hill at whose foot lies a 
beautiful lake of the same name.</p>
<p>The road from here to Tindosoe, about sixteen miles, is not practicable 
for vehicles, and I therefore left my carriol here and proceeded on 
horseback.&nbsp; The country grows more quiet and uninhabited, and the 
valleys become real chasms.&nbsp; Two lakes of considerable size form an 
agreeable variety to the wildness of the scenery.&nbsp; The larger one, 
called the Foelsoe, is of a regular form, and above two miles in diameter; 
it is encircled by picturesque mountains.&nbsp; The effect of the shadows 
which the pine-covered mountain-tops throw on the lakes is particularly 
attractive.&nbsp; I rode along its shores for more than an hour, and had 
leisure to see and examine every thing very accurately, for the horses here
travel at a very slow pace.&nbsp; The reason of this is partly that the 
guide has no horse, and walks beside you in a very sleepy manner; the horse
knows its master&rsquo;s peculiarities by long experience, and is only too 
willing to encourage him in his slow, dull pace.&nbsp; I spent more than 
five hours in reaching Tindosoe.&nbsp; My next object of interest was the 
celebrated waterfall of Rykanfoss, to reach which we had to cross a large 
lake.&nbsp; Although it had rained incessantly for an hour, and the sky 
looked threatening, I at once hired a boat with two rowers to continue my 
journey without interruption; for I anticipated a storm, and then I should 
not have found a boatman who would have ventured a voyage of four or five 
hours on this dangerous lake.&nbsp; In two hours my boat was ready, and I 
started in the pouring rain, but rejoiced at least at the absence of fog, 
which would have concealed the beauties of nature which surrounded 
me.&nbsp; The lake is eighteen miles long, but in many parts only from two 
to three miles wide.&nbsp; It is surrounded by mountains, which rise in 
terraces without the least gap to admit a distant view.&nbsp; As the 
mountains are nearly all covered with dark fir-groves, and overshadow the 
whole breadth of the narrow lake, the water seems quite dark, and almost 
black.&nbsp; This lake is dangerous to navigate on account of the many 
rocks rising perpendicularly out of the water, which, in a storm, shatter a
boat dashed against them to pieces, and the passengers would find an 
inevitable grave in the deep waters.&nbsp; We had a flesh and a favourable 
breeze, which blew us quickly to our destination.&nbsp; One of the rocks on
the coast has a very loud echo.</p>
<p>An island about a mile long divides the lake into equal parts; and when 
we had passed it, the landscape became quite peculiar.&nbsp; The mountains 
seemed to push before each other, and try whose foot should extend farthest
into the sea.&nbsp; This forms numerous lovely bays; but few of them are 
adapted for landing, as the dangerous rocks seem to project every 
where.</p>
<p>The little dots of field and meadow which seem to hang against the rock,
and the modest cottages of the peasants, which are built on the points of 
the most dangerous precipices, and over which rocks and stones tower as 
mountains, present a very curious appearance.&nbsp; The most fearful rocks 
hang over the huts, and threaten to crush them by falling, which would 
inevitably carry cottage and field with them into the sea.&nbsp; It is 
difficult to say whether the boldness or the stupidity of the peasants 
induces them to choose such localities for their dwellings.</p>
<p>From the mountains many rivers flow into the lake, and form beautiful 
falls.&nbsp; This might only have been the case at that time, because it 
was raining incessantly, and the water poured down from all sides, so that 
the mountains seemed embroidered with silver threads.&nbsp; It was a 
beautiful sight; but I would willingly have relinquished it for a day of 
sunshine.&nbsp; It is no trifle to be exposed to such a shower-bath from 
morning till night; I was wet through, and had no hope for better weather, 
as the sky was clouded all round.&nbsp; My perseverance was nearly 
exhausted; and I was on the point of relinquishing the purpose of my 
journey,&mdash;the sight of the highest Norwegian waterfall,&mdash;when it 
occurred to me that the bad weather was most favourable for my plan, as 
each drop of water would increase the splendour of the waterfall.</p>
<p>After three hours and a half&rsquo;s rowing we reached Haukaness-am-See,
where it is usual to stop a night as there is a pretty farm here, and the 
distance from the fall is still considerable.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">August 27th.</p>
<p>My first care in the morning was the weather; it was unchanged, and the 
experienced peasants prophesied that it would remain wet.&nbsp; As I would 
not return nor wait for better weather, I could only take to my boat again,
put on my half-dried cloak, and row on boldly.</p>
<p>The termination of the lake, which we soon reached, was already 
sufficient to compensate for my perseverance.&nbsp; A high mountain 
advances into the lake, and divides it into two beautiful bays.&nbsp; We 
entered the left bay, and landed at Mael, which lies at the mouth of the 
river Rykaness.&nbsp; The distance from Haukaness is a little more than two
miles.&nbsp; I had to mount a horse to reach the waterfall, which was yet 
eleven miles distant.&nbsp; The road runs through a narrow valley, which 
gradually narrows still more until it can only contain the river; and the 
traveller is obliged to ascend the heights and grope on along the sides of 
the mountains.&nbsp; Below in the vale he sees the foam of the waves 
surging against the rocks; they flow like a narrow band of silver in the 
deep chasm.&nbsp; Sometimes the path is so high that one neither sees nor 
hears the river.&nbsp; The last half mile has to be journeyed on foot, and 
goes past spots which are really dangerous; numerous waterfalls rush from 
the mountain-sides, and have to be crossed on paths of tree-trunks laid 
alongside each other; and roads scarcely a foot wide lead along giddy 
precipices.&nbsp; But the traveller may trust unhesitatingly to his 
guide&rsquo;s arm, who has hitherto led every one in safety to his 
destination.</p>
<p>The road from Haukaness to the waterfall must be the finest that can be 
imagined on a bright sunny day; for I was enchanted with the 
wildly-romantic scenery in spite of the incessant rain and my wet clothes, 
and would on no consideration have missed this sight.&nbsp; Unfortunately 
the bad weather increased, and thick fogs rolled down into the 
valleys.&nbsp; The water flowed down from the mountains, and transformed 
our narrow path into a brook, through which we had to wade ankle-deep in 
water.&nbsp; At last we reached the spot which afforded the best view of 
the fall.&nbsp; It was yet free from mist, and I could still admire the 
extraordinary beauty of the fall and its quantity of water.&nbsp; I saw the
immense mountain-rock which closes the valley, the tremendous pillar of 
water which dashes over it, and rebounds from the rock projecting in the 
centre of the fall, filling the whole valley with clouds of spray, and 
concealing the depth to which it descends.&nbsp; I saw this, one of the 
rarest and of the most magnificent of natural beauties; but alas, I saw it 
only for a moment, and had scarcely time to recover from the surprise of 
the first view when I lost it for ever!&nbsp; I was not destined to see the
single grandeurs of the fall and of the surrounding scenery, and was fain 
to be content with one look, one glance.&nbsp; Impenetrable mists rolled 
from all sides into the wild glen, and shrouded every thing in complete 
darkness; I sat on a piece of rock, and gazed for two hours stedfastly at 
the spot where a faint outline of the fall was scarcely distinguishable 
through the mist sometimes this faint trace even was lost, and I could 
perceive its vicinity only by the dreadful sounds of the fall, and by the 
trembling of the rock beneath my feet.</p>
<p>After I had gazed, and hoped, and raised my eyes entreatingly to heaven 
for a single ray of sunshine, all in vain, I had at last to determine on my
return.&nbsp; I left my post almost with tears in my eyes, and turned my 
head more backwards than forwards as we left the spot.&nbsp; At the least 
indication of a clearing away of the fog I should have returned.</p>
<p>But I retired farther and farther from it till I reached Mael again, 
where I sadly entered my boat, and proceeded uninterruptedly to 
Tindosoe.&nbsp; I arrived there towards ten o&rsquo;clock at night.&nbsp; 
The wet, the cold, the want of food, and, above all, the depressed and 
disappointed state of my mind, had so affected me, that I went to bed with 
a slight attack of fever, and feared that I should not be able to continue 
my journey on the following day.&nbsp; But my strong constitution triumphed
over every thing, and at five o&rsquo;clock in the morning I was ready to 
continue my journey to Bolkesoe on horseback.</p>
<p>I was obliged to hurry for fear of missing the departure of the steamer 
from Christiania.&nbsp; The journey to Delemarken had been represented to 
me as much shorter than I found it in reality; for the constant waiting for
horses, boats, guides, &amp;c. takes up very much time.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">August 28th.</p>
<p>I had ordered my horse to be ready at five o&rsquo;clock, but was 
obliged to wait for it until seven o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>Although I made only a short trip into the interior, I had sufficient 
opportunities for experiencing the extortions and inconveniences to which a
traveller is liable in Norway.&nbsp; No country in Europe is so much in its
infancy as regards all conveniences for locomotion.&nbsp; It is true that 
horses, carriages, boats, &amp;c. can be had at every station, and the law 
has fixed the price of these commodities; but every thing is in the hands 
of the peasants and the publicans, and they are so skilled in tormenting 
the traveller by their intentional slowness, that he is compelled to pay 
the two-fold tax, in order to proceed a little more quickly.&nbsp; The 
stations are short, being rarely above five or six miles, and one is 
therefore constantly changing horses.&nbsp; Arrived at a station, it either
happens that there is really no horse to be had, or that this is an 
ostensible excuse.&nbsp; The traveller is told that the horse has to be 
fetched from the mountain, and that he can be served in one and a half or 
two hours.&nbsp; Thus he rides one hour, and waits two.&nbsp; It is also 
necessary to keep the tariff, as every trifle, the saddle, the carriage, 
the harness, fetching the horse, the boat, &amp;c., has to be paid for 
extra; and when the traveller does not know the fixed prices, he is certain
to be dreadfully imposed upon.&nbsp; At every station a book lies, 
containing the legal prices; but it is written in the language of the 
district, and utterly unintelligible to the stranger.&nbsp; Into this book,
which is examined by the judge of the district every month, one may enter 
complaints against the peasant or publican; but they do not seem to fear 
it, for the guide who accompanied me to the fall of Rykanfoss endeavoured 
to cheat me twice in the most barefaced manner, by charging me six-fold for
the use of the saddles and the fetching of the horse.&nbsp; When I 
threatened to inscribe my complaint in the book, he seemed not to care, and
insisted on his demand, till I was obliged to pay him.&nbsp; On my return 
to Mael, I kept my word, asked for the book, and entered my complaint, 
although I was alone with all the peasants.&nbsp; It was not so much the 
money which annoyed me, as the shameless imposition.&nbsp; I am of opinion 
that every one should complain when he is wronged; if it does not benefit 
him, it will make the matter more easy for his successor.</p>
<p>I must confess, in justice to the peasants, that they were very 
indignant when I told them of the dishonesty of their countryman, and did 
not attempt to prevent my complaint.</p>
<p>To conclude my journey, I need only remark that, although the rain had 
ceased, the sky was still covered with clouds, and the country shrouded in 
mist.&nbsp; I therefore took the shorter road to Christiania, by which I 
had come, although I thereby missed a beautiful district, where I should, 
as I was told, have seen the most splendid perspective views in 
Norway.&nbsp; This would have been on the road from Kongsberg over 
Kroxleben to Christiania.&nbsp; The finest part is near Kroxleben.</p>
<p>But the time was too short to take this round, and I returned by way of 
Drammen.&nbsp; In the village of Muni, about five miles from Kongsberg, 
where I arrived at seven o&rsquo;clock in the evening, the amiable host 
wished to keep me waiting again two hours for a horse; and as this would 
probably have happened at every station, I was obliged to hire a horse for 
the whole distance to Christiania, at a threefold price.&nbsp; I slept here
for a few hours, left in the night at one o&rsquo;clock, and arrived at 
Christiania the following afternoon at two.</p>
<p>On this journey I found all those people very kind and obliging with 
whom I came into no sort of pecuniary relation; but the hosts, the boatmen,
the drivers, the guides, were as selfish and grasping as in any other 
country.&nbsp; I believe that kindness and disinterestedness would only be 
found in any district by him who has the good fortune to be the first 
traveller.</p>
<p>This little excursion was very dear; and yet I think I could now travel 
cheaply even in this country, universally acknowledged to be dear.&nbsp; I 
would go with the steamer along the coast to Hammerfest, buy a little 
vehicle and a good horse there, and then travel pleasantly, and without 
annoyance, through the whole country.&nbsp; But for a family who wished to 
travel in a comfortable covered carriage, it would be incalculably dear, 
and in many parts impossible, on account of the bad roads.</p>
<p>The Norwegian peasantry are strong and robust, but their features are 
not the most comely, and they seemed neither wealthy nor cleanly.&nbsp; 
They were generally very poorly clad, and always barefooted.&nbsp; Their 
cottages, built of wood and covered with tiles, are more roomy than those 
of the Icelanders; but they are nevertheless dirty and wretched.&nbsp; A 
weakness of the Norwegians is their fondness for coffee, which they drink 
without milk or sugar.&nbsp; The old women, as well as the men, smoke their
pipes morning and night.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<p style="text-align: right">August 30th.</p>
<p>At seven o&rsquo;clock this morning I left Christiania, accompanied by 
the good wishes of my countrywoman and her husband, and went back to 
Gottenburg by the same steamer which had brought me thence ten days 
before.&nbsp; I need only mention the splendid view of a portion of 
Christian&rsquo;s Sound&mdash;also called Fiord&mdash;which I lost on the 
former journey from the darkness of the night.&nbsp; We passed it in the 
afternoon.&nbsp; The situation of the little town of Lauervig is 
superb.&nbsp; It is built on a natural terrace, bordered in the background 
by beautiful mountains.&nbsp; In front, the fortress of Friedrichsver lies 
on a mountain surrounded by rocks, on which little watch-towers are 
erected; to the left lies the vast expanse of sea.</p>
<p>We were delayed an hour at Friedrichsver to transfer the travellers for 
Bergen <a name="citation50"></a><a href="#footnote50" 
class="citation">[50]</a> to a vessel waiting for them, as we had stopped 
on our previous journey at Sandesund for the same purpose.</p>
<p>This is the last view in the fiord; for now we steered into the open 
sea, and in a few hours we had lost sight of land.&nbsp; We saw nothing but
land and water till we arrived the next morning at the Scheren, and steered
for Gottenburg.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">August 31st.</p>
<p>The sea had been rough all night, and we therefore reached Gottenburg 
three hours later than usual.&nbsp; In this agitated sea, the surging of 
the breakers against the many rocks and islets near Gottenburg has a very 
curious effect.</p>
<p>The few travellers who could keep on their feet, who did not suffer from
sea-sickness, and remained on deck, spoke much of the dangerous 
storm.&nbsp; I had frequently marvelled to hear people who had made a 
journey, if it were even only a short one of forty to sixty leagues, relate
of some fearful storm they had witnessed.&nbsp; Now I comprehended the 
reason, when I heard the travellers beside me call the brisk breeze, which 
only occasioned what seamen call a little swell, a dreadful storm; and they
will probably tell at home of the dangers they have passed.&nbsp; Storms 
are, fortunately, not so frequent.&nbsp; I have travelled many thousand 
leagues, and have often met with stormy weather, especially on the passage 
from Copenhagen to Iceland; but I only experienced one real storm, but a 
violent and dangerous one, as I was crossing the Black Sea to 
Constantinople in April 1842.</p>
<p>We arrived at Gottenburg at nine instead of at six o&rsquo;clock in the 
morning.&nbsp; I landed at once, to make the celebrated trip through the 
locks, over the waterfalls of Trollh&auml;tta, with the next Stockholm 
steamer.&nbsp; By the junction of the river G&ouml;tha with some of the 
interior lakes, this great construction crosses the whole country, and 
connects the North Sea with the Baltic.</p>
<p>I found the town of Gottenburg very animated, on account of the presence
of the king of Sweden, who was spending a few days here on his way to 
Christiania to prorogue the Storthing.&nbsp; I arrived on a Sunday, and the
king, with his son, were in the church.&nbsp; The streets swarmed with 
human beings, all crowding towards the cathedral to catch a glimpse of his 
majesty on his departure.&nbsp; I, of course, mingled with the crowd, and 
was fortunate enough to see the king and prince come out of the church, 
enter their carriage, and drive away very near to me.&nbsp; Both were 
handsome, amiable-looking men.&nbsp; The people rushed after the carriage, 
and eagerly caught the friendly bows of the intelligent father and his 
hopeful son; they followed him to his palace, and stationed themselves in 
front of it, impatiently longing for the moment when the royal pair would 
appear at a window.</p>
<p>I could not have arrived at a more favourable time; for every one was in
holiday attire, and the military, the clergy, the officials, citizens and 
people, were all exerting themselves to the utmost to do honour to their 
king.</p>
<p>I noticed two peasant-girls among the crowd who were peculiarly 
dressed.&nbsp; They wore black petticoats reaching half way down the calf 
of the leg, red stockings, red spensers, and white chemises, with long 
white sleeves; a kerchief was tied round the head.&nbsp; Some of the 
citizens&rsquo; wives wore caps like the Suabian caps, covered by a little 
black, embroidered veil, which, however, left the face free.</p>
<p>Here, as in Copenhagen, I noticed boys of ten to twelve years of age 
among the drummers, and in the bands of the military.</p>
<p>The king remained this day and the next in Gottenburg, and continued his
journey on the Tuesday.&nbsp; On the two evenings of his stay the windows 
in the town were ornamented with wreaths of fresh flowers, interspersed 
with lighted tapers.&nbsp; Some houses displayed transparencies, which, 
however, did not place the inventive powers of the amiable Gottenburgers in
a very favourable light.&nbsp; They were all alike, consisting of a 
tremendous O (Oscar), surmounted by a royal crown.</p>
<p>I was detained four days in Gottenburg; and small consideration seems to
be paid to the speedy transport of travellers in Sweden.&nbsp; The steamer 
for Stockholm started on the day I arrived from Christiania, but 
unfortunately at five o&rsquo;clock in the morning; and as in the month of 
September only two steamers go in the week to Stockholm, I was compelled to
wait till Thursday.&nbsp; The time hung heavily on my hands; for I had seen
the town itself, and the splendid views on the hills between the suburbs, 
during my former visit to the town, and the other portions only consisted 
of bare rocks and cliffs, which were of no interest.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">September 4th.</p>
<p>The press of travellers was so great this time, that two days before the
departure the cabins were all engaged; several ladies and gentlemen who 
would not wait for the next steamer were compelled to be satisfied with the
deck, and I was among them; for the probability of such a crowd of 
passengers had not occurred to me, and I applied for a place only two days 
before our departure.&nbsp; During the journey fresh passengers were taken 
in at every station, and the reader may conceive the misery of the poor 
citizens unused to such hardships.&nbsp; Every one sought a shelter for the
night, and the little cabins of the engineer and steersman were given up to
some, while others crept into the passages, or squatted down on the steps 
of the stairs leading to the cabins.&nbsp; A place was offered to me in the
engineer&rsquo;s cabin; but as three or four other persons were to share 
the apartment calculated only for one person, I preferred to bivouac night 
and day upon deck.&nbsp; One of the gentlemen was kind enough to lend me a 
thick cloak, in which I could wrap myself; and so I slept much more 
comfortably under the high canopy of heaven than my companions did in their
sweating-room.</p>
<p>The arrangements in the vessels navigating the G&ouml;tha canal are by 
no means the best.&nbsp; The first class is very comfortable, and the 
cabin-place is divided into pretty light divisions for two persons; but the
second class is all the more uncomfortable: its cabin is used for a common 
dining-room by day, and by night hammocks are slung up in it for sleeping 
accommodation.&nbsp; The arrangements for the luggage are worse 
still.&nbsp; The canal-boats, having only a very small hold, trunks, boxes,
portmanteaus, &amp;c. are heaped up on the deck, not fastened at all, and 
very insufficiently protected against rain.&nbsp; The consequence of this 
carelessness on a journey of five or six days was, that the rain and the 
high waves of the lakes frequently put the after-deck several inches under 
water, and then the luggage was wetted through.&nbsp; It was worse still in
a squall on the Wenner lake; for while the ship was rather roughly tossed 
about, many a trunk lost its equilibrium and fell from its high position, 
frequently endangering the safety of the passengers&rsquo; heads.&nbsp; The
fares are, however, very cheap, which seemed doubly strange, as the many 
locks must cause considerable expense.</p>
<p>And now for the journey itself.&nbsp; We started at five o&rsquo;clock 
in the morning, and soon arrived in the river G&ouml;tha, whose shores for 
the first few miles are flat and bare.&nbsp; The valley itself is bounded 
by bare, rocky hills.&nbsp; After about nine miles we came to the town of 
Kongelf, which is said to have 1000 inhabitants.&nbsp; It is so situated 
among rocks, that it is almost hidden from view.&nbsp; On a rock opposite 
the town are the ruins of the fortress Bogus.&nbsp; Now the scenery begins 
to be a little more diversified, and forests are mingled with the bleak 
rocks; little valleys appear on both the shores; and the river itself, here
divided by an islet, frequently expands to a considerable breadth.&nbsp; 
The peasants&rsquo; cottages were larger and better than those in Norway; 
they are generally painted brick-red, and are often built in groups.</p>
<p>The first lock is at Lilla Edet: there are five here; and while the ship
passes through them, the passengers have leisure to admire the contiguous 
low, but broad and voluminous fall of the G&ouml;tha.</p>
<p>This first batch of locks in the canal extends over some distance past 
the fall, and they are partly blasted out of the rock, or built of 
stone.&nbsp; The river past Akestron flows as through a beautiful park; the
valley is hemmed in by fertile hills, and leaves space only for the stream 
and some picturesque paths winding along its shores, and through the 
pine-groves descending to its banks.</p>
<p>In the afternoon we arrived at the celebrated locks near 
Trollh&auml;tta.&nbsp; They are of gigantic construction, which the largest
states would be honoured in completing, and which occasion surprise when 
found in a country ranking high neither in extent nor in influence.&nbsp; 
There are eleven locks here, which rise 112 feet in a space of 3500 
feet.&nbsp; They are broad, deep, blasted out of the rock, and walled round
with fine freestone.&nbsp; They resemble the single steps of a 
giant&rsquo;s staircase; and by this name they might fitly rank as one of 
the wonders of the world.&nbsp; Lock succeeds lock, mighty gates close 
them, and the large vessel rises miraculously to the giddy heights in a 
wildly romantic country.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p219b.jpg">
<img alt="Falls of Trollhatta" src="images/p219s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Scarcely arrived at the locks, the traveller is surrounded by a crowd of
boys, who offer their services as guides to the waterfalls near 
Trollh&auml;tta.&nbsp; There is abundance of time for this excursion; for 
the passage of the ship through the many locks occupies three to four 
hours, and the excursion can be made in half the time.&nbsp; Before 
starting, it is, however, advisable to climb the rock to which the locks 
ascend.&nbsp; A pavilion is erected on its summit, and the view from it 
down over all the locks is exceedingly fine.</p>
<p>Pretty paths hewn out of the wood lead to Trollh&auml;tta, which is 
charmingly situated in a lovely valley, surrounded by woods and hills, on 
the shore of a river, whose white foaming waves contrast strongly with the 
dark foliage of the overshadowing groves.&nbsp; The canal, which describes 
a large semicircle round the chief stream, glitters in the distance; but 
the highest locks are quite concealed behind rocks; we could neither 
observe the opening of the gates nor the rising of the water in them, and 
were therefore surprised when suddenly the masts and then the ship itself 
rose from the depth.&nbsp; An invisible hand seemed to raise it up between 
the rocks.</p>
<p>The falls of the river are less distinguished for their height than for 
their diversity and their volumes of water.&nbsp; The principal arm of the 
river is divided at the point of decline into two equal falls by a little 
island of rock.&nbsp; A long narrow suspension-bridge leads to this island,
and hangs over the fall; but it is such a weak, frail construction, that 
one person only can cross it at a time.&nbsp; The owner of this dangerous 
path keeps it private, and imposes a toll of about 3&frac12;d. on all 
passengers.</p>
<p>A peculiar sensation oppresses the traveller crossing the slender 
path.&nbsp; He sees the stream tearing onwards, breaking itself on the 
projecting rock, and fall surging into the abyss; he sees the boiling waves
beneath, and feels the bridge vibrate at every footstep, and timidly 
hastens to reach the island, not taking breath to look around until he has 
found footing; on the firm island.&nbsp; A solid rock projects a little 
over the fall, and affords him a safe position, whence he sees not only the
two falls on either side, but also several others formed above and below 
his point of view.&nbsp; The scene is so enchanting, that it is difficult 
to tear oneself away.</p>
<p>Beyond Trollh&auml;tta the river expands almost to a lake, and is 
separated into many arms by the numerous islands.&nbsp; The shores lose 
their beauty, being flat and uninteresting.</p>
<p>We unfortunately did not reach the splendid Wennersee, which is from 
forty-five to sixty-five miles long, and proportionally broad, until 
evening, when it was already too dark to admire the scenery.&nbsp; Our ship
remained some hours before the insignificant village Wennersborg.</p>
<p>We had met six or seven steamers on our journey, which all belonged to 
Swedish or Norwegian merchants; and it afforded us a peculiarly interesting
sight to see these ships ascend and descend in the high locks.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">September 5th.</p>
<p>As we were leaving Wennersborg late on the previous night, and were 
cruising about the sea, a contrary wind, or rather a squall, arose, which 
would have signified little to a good vessel, but to which our small ship 
was not equal.&nbsp; The poor captain tried in vain to navigate the steamer
across the lake; he was at last compelled to give up the attempt, to return
and to cast anchor.&nbsp; We lost our boat during this storm; a high wave 
dashed over the deck and swept it away: it had probably been as well 
fastened as our boxes and trunks.</p>
<p>Though it was but nine o&rsquo;clock in the morning, our captain 
declared that he could not proceed during the day, but that if the weather 
became more favourable, he would start again about midnight.&nbsp; 
Fortunately a fishing-boat ventured to come alongside, and some of the 
passengers landed.&nbsp; I was among them, and made use of this opportunity
to visit some cottages lying at the edge of a wood near the lake.&nbsp; 
They were very small, but consisted of two chambers, which contained 
several beds and other furniture; the people were also somewhat better clad
than the Norwegians.&nbsp; Their food too was not so unpalatable; they 
boiled a thick mess of coarse black flour, which was eaten with sweet 
milk.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">September 6th.</p>
<p>We raised anchor at one o&rsquo;clock in the morning, and in about five 
hours arrived at the island Eken, which consists entirely of rock, and is 
surrounded by a multitude of smaller islets and cliffs.&nbsp; This is one 
of the most important stations in the lake.&nbsp; A large wooden warehouse 
stands on the shore, and in it is stored the merchandise of the vicinity 
intended for export; and in return it receives the cargo from the 
ships.&nbsp; There are always several vessels lying at anchor here.</p>
<p>We had now to wind through a cluster of islands, till we again reached 
the open lake, which, however, was only remarkable for its size.&nbsp; Its 
shores are bare and monotonous, and only dotted here and there with woods 
or low hills; the distant view even is not at all noteworthy.&nbsp; One of 
the finest views is the tolerably large castle of Leko, which lies on a 
rock, and is surrounded by fertile groves.</p>
<p>Further off rises the Kinne Kulle, <a name="citation51"></a><a 
href="#footnote51" class="citation">[51]</a> to which the traveller&rsquo;s
attention is directed, because it is said to afford an extended view, not 
only over the lake, but far into the country.&nbsp; A curious grotto is 
said to exist in this hill; but unfortunately one loses these sights since 
the establishment of steamers, for we fly past every object of interest, 
and the longest journey will soon be described in a few words.</p>
<p>A large glass-factory is established at Bromoe, which fabricates 
window-glass exclusively.&nbsp; We stopped a short time, and took a 
considerable cargo of the brittle material on board.</p>
<p>The factory and the little dwellings attached to it are prettily 
situated on the undulating ground.</p>
<p>Near Sjotorp we entered the river again through several locks.&nbsp; The
passage of the Wennersee is calculated at about ten or eleven hours.</p>
<p>The river at first winds through woods; and while the ship slowly passes
through the locks, it is pleasanter to walk a portion of the distance in 
their shade.&nbsp; Farther on it flows through broad valleys, which, 
however, present no very attractive features.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">September 7th.</p>
<p>Early in the morning we crossed the pretty Vikensee, which distinguishes
itself, like all Swedish lakes, by the multitude of its islands, cliffs, 
and rocks.&nbsp; These islands are frequently covered with trees, which 
make the view more interesting.</p>
<p>The lake is 306 feet above the level of the North Sea, and is the 
highest point of the journey; from thence the locks begin to descend.&nbsp;
The number of ascending and descending locks amounts to seventy-two.</p>
<p>A short canal leads into the Boltensee, which is comparatively free from
islands.&nbsp; The passage across this little lake is very charming; the 
shores are diversified by hills, woods, meadows, and fields.&nbsp; After it
comes the Weltersee, which can be easily defended by the beautiful fortress
of Karlsborg.&nbsp; This lake has two peculiarities: one being the 
extraordinary purity and transparency of its waters; the other, the number 
of storms which prevail in it.&nbsp; I was told that it frequently raged 
and stormed on the lake while the surrounding country remained calm and 
free.&nbsp; The storm sometimes overtakes the ship so suddenly and 
violently, that escape is impossible; and the sagas and fables told of the 
deceitful tricks of these waves are innumerable.</p>
<p>We fortunately escaped, and crossed its surface cheerfully and 
merrily.&nbsp; On its shores are situated the beautiful ladies&rsquo; 
pensionary, Wadstena, and the celebrated mountain Omberg, at whose foot a 
battle was fought.</p>
<p>The next canal is short, and leads through a lovely wood into the little
lake of Norbysee.&nbsp; It is customary to walk this distance, and inspect 
the simple monument of Count Platen, who made the plans for the locks and 
canals,&mdash;a lasting, colossal undertaking.&nbsp; The monument is 
surrounded by an iron railing, and consists of a slab bearing an 
inscription, simply stating in Swedish his name, the date of his death, 
&amp;c.&nbsp; Nearly opposite the monument, on the other side of the canal,
is the town of Motala, distinguished principally for its large iron 
factories, in which the spacious work-rooms are especially remarkable.</p>
<p>Fifteen locks lead from the Norbysee into the Roxersee, which is a 
descent of 116 feet.&nbsp; The canal winds gracefully through woods and 
meadows, crossed by pretty roads, and studded with elegant little houses 
and larger edifices.&nbsp; Distant church-steeples point out the village of
Norby, which sometimes peeps forth behind little forests, and then vanishes
again from the view of the traveller.&nbsp; When the sun shines on the 
waters of this canal, it has a beautiful, transparent, pea-green colour, 
like the purest chrysolite.</p>
<p>The view from the hill which rises immediately before the lake of Roxen 
is exceedingly fine.&nbsp; It looks down upon an immense valley, covered 
with the most beautiful woods and rocks, and upon the broad lake, whose arm
flows far in land.&nbsp; The evening sun shed its last rays over a little 
town on the lake-shore, and its newly-painted tiles shone brightly in its 
light beams.</p>
<p>While the ship descended through the many locks, we visited the 
neighbouring church of the village of Vretakloster, which contains the 
skeletons of several kings in beautifully-made metal coffins.</p>
<p>We then crossed the lake, which is from four to five miles broad, and 
remained all night before the entrance of the canal leading into a bay of 
the Baltic.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">September 8th.</p>
<p>This canal is one of the longest; its environs are very pretty, and the 
valley through which it runs is one of the largest we had passed.&nbsp; The
town of S&ouml;derk&ouml;ping is situated at the foot of high, picturesque 
groups of rocks, which extend to a considerable distance.</p>
<p>Every valley and every spot of soil in Sweden are carefully 
cultivated.</p>
<p>The people in general are well dressed, and inhabit small but very 
pretty houses, whose windows are frequently decorated with clean white 
draperies.&nbsp; I visited several of these houses, as we had abundance of 
time for such excursions while the ship was going through the locks.&nbsp; 
I think one might walk the whole distance from Gottenburg to Stockholm in 
the same time that the ship takes for the journey.&nbsp; We lose some hours
daily with the locks, and are obliged to lie still at night on their 
account.&nbsp; The distance is calculated at from 180 to 250 miles, and the
journey takes five days.</p>
<p>In the evening we approached the Baltic, which has the same character as
the Scheren of the North Sea.&nbsp; The ship threads its way through a 
shoal of islands and islets, of rocks and cliffs; and it is as difficult to
imagine here as there how it is possible to avoid all the projecting 
cliffs, and guide the ship so safely through them.&nbsp; The sea divides 
itself into innumerable arms and bays, into small and large lakes, which 
are formed between the islands and rocks, and are hemmed in by beautiful 
hills.&nbsp; But nothing can exceed the beauty of the view of the castle 
Storry Husby, which lies on a high mountain, in a bay.&nbsp; In front of 
the mountain a beautiful meadow-lawn reaches to the shores of the sea, 
while the back is surrounded in the distance by a splendid 
pine-forest.&nbsp; Near this picturesque castle a steeple rises on a 
neighbouring island, which is all that remains of the ancient castle of 
Stegeborg.&nbsp; Nothing can be more romantic than the scenery here, and on
the whole journey over the fiord; for it presents itself in ever-varying 
pictures to the traveller&rsquo;s notice.</p>
<p>But gradually the hills become lower, the islands more rare; the sea 
supersedes every thing, and seems jealously anxious to exclude other 
objects from the traveller&rsquo;s attention, as if it wished to monopolise
it.&nbsp; Now we were in the open sea, and saw only water and sky; and then
again we were so hemmed in by the rocks and cliffs, that it would be 
impossible to extricate the ship without the assistance of an experienced 
pilot.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">September 9th.</p>
<p>We left the sea, and entered another lake, the M&auml;larsee, celebrated
for its numerous islands, by a short canal.&nbsp; The town of Sotulje lies 
at its entrance, charmingly situated in a narrow valley at the foot of a 
rather steep hill.&nbsp; This lake at first resembles a broad river, but 
widens at every step, and soon shews itself in its whole expanse.&nbsp; The
passage of the M&auml;larsee takes four hours, and is one of the most 
charming excursions that can be made.&nbsp; It is said to contain about a 
thousand islets of various sizes; and it may be imagined how varied in form
and feature the scenery must be, and, like the fiord of the Baltic, what a 
constant succession of new scenes it must present.</p>
<p>The shores also are very beautiful: in some spots hills descend sharply 
to the water&rsquo;s edge, the steep rocks forming dangerous points; on 
others dark, sombre pine-forests grow; and again there are gay valleys and 
meadows, with villages or single cottages.&nbsp; Many travellers assert 
that this lake is, after all, very monotonous; but I cannot agree with 
their opinion.&nbsp; I found it so attractive, that I could repeat the 
journey many times without wearying of this lovely sameness.&nbsp; It 
certainly has not the majestic backgrounds of the Swiss lakes; but this 
profusion of small islands is a pleasing peculiarity which can be found on 
no other lake.</p>
<p>On the summit of a steep precipice of the shore the hat of the 
unfortunate Eric is hoisted, fastened to a long pole.&nbsp; History tells 
that this king fled from the enemy in a battle; that one of his soldiers 
pursued him, and reproached him for his cowardice, whereupon Eric, filled 
with shame and despair, gave spurs to his horse and leaped into the fearful
abyss.&nbsp; At his fall his hat was blown from his head, and was left on 
this spot.</p>
<p>Not far from this point the suburbs of Stockholm make their appearance, 
being spread round one of the broad arms of the lake.&nbsp; With increasing
curiosity we gazed towards the town as we gradually approached it.&nbsp; 
Many of the pretty villas, which are situated in the valleys or on the 
sides of the hills as forerunners of the town, come into view, and the 
suburbs rise amphi-theatrically on the steep shores.&nbsp; The town itself 
closes the prospect by occupying the whole upper shore of the lake, and is 
flanked by the suburbs at either side.&nbsp; The Ritterholm church, with 
its cast-iron perforated towers, and the truly grand royal palace, which is
built entirely in the Italian style, can be seen and admired from this 
distance.</p>
<p>We had scarcely cast anchor in the port of Stockholm, when a number of 
Herculean women came and offered us their services as porters.&nbsp; They 
were Delekarliers, <a name="citation52"></a><a href="#footnote52" 
class="citation">[52]</a> who frequently come to Stockholm to earn a 
livelihood as porters, water-carriers, boatwomen, &amp;c.&nbsp; They easily
find employment, because they possess two excellent qualities: they are 
said to be exceedingly honest and hard-working, and, at the same time, have
the strength and perseverance of men.</p>
<p>Their dress consists of black petticoats, which come half way over the 
calf of the leg, red bodices, white chemises with long sleeves, short 
narrow aprons of two colours, red stockings, and shoes with wooden soles an
inch thick.&nbsp; They twist a handkerchief round their head, or put on a 
little close black cap, which fits close on the back part of the head.</p>
<p>In Stockholm there are entire houses, as well as single rooms, which, as
in a hotel, are let by the day.&nbsp; They are much cheaper than hotels, 
and are therefore more in demand.&nbsp; I at once hired one of these rooms,
which was very clean and bright, and for which, with breakfast, I only paid
one riksdaler, which is about one shilling.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<p>As my journey was ostensibly only to Iceland, and as I only paid a 
flying visit to this portion of Scandinavia, my readers will pardon me if I
treat it briefly.&nbsp; This portion of Europe has been so frequently and 
so excellently described by other travellers, that my observations would be
of little importance.</p>
<p>I remained in Stockholm six days, and made as good use of my time as I 
could.&nbsp; The town is situated on the shores of the Baltic Sea and the 
M&auml;lar lake.&nbsp; These two waters are connected by a short canal, on 
whose shores the most delightful houses are erected.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p230b.jpg">
<img alt="Stockholm" src="images/p230s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>My first visit was to the beautiful church of Ritterholm, which is used 
more for a cemetery and an armory than for a place of worship.&nbsp; The 
vaults serve as burial-places for the kings, and their monuments are 
erected in the side-chapels.&nbsp; On each side of the nave of the church 
are placed effigies of armed knights on horseback, whose armour belonged to
the former kings of Sweden.&nbsp; The walls and angles of the church are 
profusely decorated with flags and standards, said to number five 
thousand.&nbsp; In addition to this, the keys of conquered towns and 
fortresses hang along the side-walls, and drums are piled upon the floor; 
trophies taken from different nations with which Sweden has been at 
war.</p>
<p>Besides these curiosities, several coats of armour and garments of 
Swedish regents are displayed behind glass-cases in the side-chapels.&nbsp;
Among them, the dress which Charles XII. wore on the day of his death, and 
his hat perforated by a ball, interested me most.&nbsp; His riding-boots 
stand on the ground beside it.&nbsp; The modern dress and hat, embroidered 
with gold and ornamented with feathers, of the last king, the founder of 
the new dynasty, is not less interesting, partly perhaps from the great 
contrast.</p>
<p>The church of St. Nicholas stands on the same side of the canal, and is 
one of the finest Protestant churches I had seen; it is very evident that 
it was built in Catholic times, and that its former decorations have been 
allowed to remain.&nbsp; It contains several large and small oil-paintings,
some ancient and some modern monuments, and a profusion of gilding.&nbsp; 
The organ is fine and large; flanking the entrance of the church are 
beautiful reliefs, hewn in stone; and above it, carved in wood, a statue of
the archangel Michael, larger than life, sitting on horseback on a bridge, 
in the act of killing the dragon.</p>
<p>Near the church is situated the royal palace, which needs a more fluent 
pen than mine to describe it.&nbsp; It would fill a volume were I to 
enumerate and describe the treasures, curiosities, and beauties of its 
construction, or its interior arrangement; I can only say that I never saw 
any thing to equal it, except the royal palace of Naples.&nbsp; Such an 
edifice is the more surprising in the north, and in a country which has 
never been overstocked with wealth.</p>
<p>The church of Shifferholm is remarkable only for its position and its 
temple-like form; it stands on the ledge of a rock facing the royal palace,
on the opposite shore of the same indentation of the Baltic.&nbsp; A long 
bridge of boats leads from the one to the other.</p>
<p>The church of St. Catharine is large and beautiful.&nbsp; In an outer 
angle of the church is shewn the stone on which one of the brothers Sturre 
was beheaded. <a name="citation53"></a><a href="#footnote53" 
class="citation">[53]</a></p>
<p>On the Ritterplatz stands the Ritterhouse, a very fine palace; also the 
old royal palace, and several other royal and private mansions; but they 
are not nearly so numerous nor so fine as in Copenhagen, and the streets 
and squares also cannot be compared with those of the capital of 
Denmark.</p>
<p>The finest prospect is from a hill in one of the suburbs called the 
Great Mosbecken; it affords a magnificent view of the sea and the lake, of 
the town and its suburbs, as far as the points of the mountains, and of the
lovely country-houses which border the shores of lake and sea.&nbsp; The 
town and its environs are so interspersed with islets and rocks, that these
seem to be part of the town; and this gives Stockholm such a curious 
appearance, that I can compare it to no other city I have seen.&nbsp; 
Wooded hills and naked rocks prolong the view, and their ridges extend into
the far distance; while level fields and lawns take up but a very small 
proportion of the magnificent scenery.</p>
<p>On descending from this hill the traveller should not fail to go to 
S&ouml;dermalm, and to inspect the immense iron-stores, where iron is 
heaped up in countless bars.&nbsp; The corn-market of Stockholm is 
insignificant.&nbsp; The principal buildings besides those already 
enumerated are, the bank, the mint, the guard-house, the palace of the 
crown-prince, the theatre, &amp;c.&nbsp; The latter is interesting, partly 
because Gustavus III. was shot in it.&nbsp; He fell on the stage, while a 
grand masquerade was taking place, for which the theatre had been changed 
into a ball-room.&nbsp; The king was shot by a mask, and died in a few 
hours.</p>
<p>There is not a representation in the theatre every night; and on the one
evening of performance during my visit a festival was to be celebrated in 
the hall of antiquities.&nbsp; The esteemed artist Vogelberg, a native of 
Sweden, had beautifully sculptured the three heathen gods, Thor, Balder, 
and Odin, in colossal size, and brought them over from Rome.&nbsp; The 
statues had only been lately placed, and a large company had been invited 
to meet in the illuminated saloon, and do honour to the artist.&nbsp; 
Solemn hymns were to be sung at the uncovering of the statues, beside other
festivities.&nbsp; I was fortunate enough to receive an invitation to this 
festival, which was to commence a little past seven.&nbsp; Before that I 
went to the theatre, which, I was told, would open at half-past six.&nbsp; 
I intended to remain there half an hour, and then drive to the palace, 
where my friends would meet me to accompany me to the festival.&nbsp; I 
went to the theatre at six, and anxiously waited half an hour for the 
commencement of the overture; it was after half-past six, and no signs of 
the commencement.&nbsp; I looked again at the bill, and saw, to my 
annoyance, that the opera did not begin till seven.&nbsp; But as I would 
not leave until I had seen the stage, I spent the time in looking at the 
theatre itself.&nbsp; It is tolerably large, and has five tiers of boxes, 
but is neither tastefully nor richly decorated.&nbsp; I was most surprised 
at the exorbitant price and the variety of seats.&nbsp; I counted 
twenty-six different kinds; it seems that every row has a different price, 
else I don&rsquo;t understand how they could make such a variety.</p>
<p>At last the overture began; I listened to it, saw the curtain rise, 
looked at the fatal spot, and left after the first air.&nbsp; The 
door-keeper followed me, took my arm, and wished to give me a 
return-ticket; and when I told him that I did not require one, as I did not
intend to return, he said that it had only just commenced, and that I ought
to stop, and not have spent all the money for nothing.&nbsp; I was 
unfortunately too little acquainted with the Swedish language to explain 
the reason of my departure, so I could give him no answer, but went 
away.&nbsp; I, however, heard him say to some one, &ldquo;I never met with 
such a woman before; she sat an hour looking at the curtain, and goes away 
as soon as it rises.&rdquo;&nbsp; I looked round and saw how he shook his 
head thoughtfully, and pointed with his forefinger to his forehead.&nbsp; I
could not refrain from smiling, and enjoyed the scene as much as I should 
have done the second act of Mozart&rsquo;s <i>Don Giovanni</i>.</p>
<p>I called for my friends at the royal palace, and spent the evening very 
agreeably in the brilliantly-illuminated galleries of antiquities and of 
pictures.&nbsp; I had the pleasure also of being introduced to Herr 
Vogelberg.&nbsp; His modest, unpretending manners must inspire every one 
with respect, even if one does not know what distinguished talent he 
possesses.</p>
<p>The royal park is one of the finest sights in the neighbourhood of 
Stockholm, and is one of the best of its kind.&nbsp; It is a fine large 
natural park, with an infinity of groves, meadows, hills, and rocks; here 
and there lies a country-house with its fragrant flower-garden, or tasteful
coffee and refreshment houses, which on fine Sundays are filled with 
visitors from the town.&nbsp; Good roads are made through the park, and 
commodious paths lead to the finest points of view over sea and land.</p>
<p>The bust of the popular poet Bellmann stands on an open sunny spot, and 
an annual festival is given here in his honour.</p>
<p>Deeper in the park lies the so-called Rosenthal (Rose valley), a real 
Eden.&nbsp; The late king was so partial to this spot, that he spent many 
hours in the little royal country-house here, which is built on a retired 
spot in the midst of groves and flower-beds.&nbsp; In front of the palace 
stands a splendid vase made of a single piece of porphyry.&nbsp; I was told
that it was the largest in Europe, but I consider the one in the Museum of 
Naples much larger.</p>
<p>I spent the last hours of my visit to Stockholm in this spot, with the 
amiable family of Herr Boje from Finnland, whose acquaintance I had made on
the journey from Gottenburg to Stockholm.&nbsp; I shall therefore never 
forget this beautiful park and the agreeable associations connected with 
it.</p>
<p>I made a very agreeable excursion also to the royal palace of Haga, to 
the large cemetery, and to the military school Karlberg.</p>
<p>The royal castle of Haga is surrounded by a magnificent park, which owes
little to art; it contains some of the finest trees, with here and there a 
hill, and is crossed by majestic alleys and well-kept roads for driving and
walking.&nbsp; The palace itself is so small, that I could not but admire 
the moderation of the royal family; but I was informed that this is the 
smallest of their summer palaces.</p>
<p>Nearly opposite to this park is the great cemetery; but as it has only 
existed for about seventeen years, the trees in it are yet rather 
young.&nbsp; This would be of little consequence in other countries, but in
Sweden the cemeteries serve as promenades, and are crossed by alleys, 
ornamented with groves, and provided with seats for the accommodation of 
visitors.&nbsp; This cemetery is surrounded by a dark pine-forest, and 
really seems quite shut off from the outer world.&nbsp; It is the only 
burial-place out of the town; the others all lie between the churches and 
the neighbouring houses, whose fronts often form the immediate 
boundary.&nbsp; Burials take place there constantly, so that the 
inhabitants are quite familiar with the aspect of death.</p>
<p>From the great cemetery a road leads to the neighbouring Karlberg, which
is the academy for military and naval cadets.&nbsp; The extensive buildings
attached to this seminary are built on the slope of a mountain, which is 
washed on one side by the waters of the lake, and surrounded on the other 
by the beautiful park-plantations.</p>
<p>Before leaving Stockholm I had the honour of being introduced to her 
majesty the Queen of Sweden.&nbsp; She had heard of my travels, and took a 
particular interest in my account of Palestine.&nbsp; In consequence of 
this favour, I received the special permission to inspect the whole 
interior of the palace.&nbsp; Although it was inhabited, I was conducted, 
not only through the state-rooms, but through all the private rooms of the 
court.&nbsp; It would be impossible to describe the splendour which reigns 
here, the treasures of art, the magnificent appointments, and the evident 
taste every where displayed.&nbsp; I was delighted with all the treasures 
and splendour, but still more with the warm interest with which her majesty
conversed with me about Palestine.&nbsp; This interview will ever dwell on 
my memory as the bright salient point of my northern expedition.</p>
<h3>EXCURSION TO THE OLD ROYAL CASTLE OF GRIPTHOLM ON THE MALARSEE</h3>
<p>Every Sunday morning, at eight o&rsquo;clock, a little steamer leaves 
Stockholm for this castle; the distance is about forty-five miles, and is 
passed in four hours; four hours more are allowed for the stay, and in the 
evening the steamer returns to Stockholm.&nbsp; This excursion is very 
interesting, although we pass the greater part of the time on that portion 
of the lake which we had seen on our arrival, but for the last few miles 
the ship turned into a pretty bay, at whose apex the castle is 
situated.&nbsp; It is distinguished for its size, its architecture, and its
colossal turrets.&nbsp; It is unfortunately, however, painted with the 
favourite brick-red colour of the Swedes.</p>
<p>Two immense cannons, which the Swedes once gained in battle from the 
Russians, stand in the courtyard.&nbsp; The apartments in the castle, which
are kept in good condition, display neither splendour nor profusion of 
appointments, indeed almost the contrary.&nbsp; The pretty theatre is, 
however, an exception: for its walls are inlaid from top to bottom with 
mirrors, its pillars are gilt, and the royal box tapestried with rich red 
velvet.&nbsp; There has been no performance here since the death of 
Gustavus III.</p>
<p>The immensely massive walls are a remarkable feature of this palace, and
must measure about three yards in thickness in the lower stories.</p>
<p>The upper apartments are all large and high, and afford a splendid view 
of the lake from their windows.&nbsp; But it is impossible to enjoy these 
beautiful scenes when one thinks of the sad events which have taken place 
here.</p>
<p>Two kings, John III. and Eric XIV., the latter with four of his 
ministers, who were subsequently beheaded, were imprisoned here for many 
years.&nbsp; The captivity of John III. would not have been so bad, if 
captivity were not bad enough in itself.&nbsp; He was confined in a large 
splendid saloon, but which he was not permitted to quit, and which he would
therefore probably have gladly exchanged for the poorest hut and 
liberty.&nbsp; His wife inhabited two smaller apartments adjoining; she was
not treated as a prisoner, and could leave the castle at will.&nbsp; His 
son Sigismund was born here in the year 1566, and the room and bed in which
he was born are still shewn as curiosities.</p>
<p>Eric&rsquo;s fate was much more unfortunate, for he was kept in narrow 
and dark confinement.&nbsp; A small rudely-furnished apartment, with 
narrow, iron-barred windows, in one of the little turrets was his 
prison.&nbsp; The entrance was closed by a solid oaken door, in which a 
small opening had been made, through which his food was given him.&nbsp; 
For greater security this oaken door was covered by an iron one.&nbsp; 
Round the outside of the apartment a narrow gallery had been made, on which
the guards were posted, and could at all times see their prisoner through 
the barred windows.&nbsp; The spot is still shewn at one of the windows 
where the king sat for hours looking into the distance, his head leaning on
his hand.&nbsp; What must have been his feelings as he gazed on the bright 
sky, the verdant turf, and the smiling lake!&nbsp; How many sighs must have
been echoed from these walls, how many sleepless nights must he have passed
during those two long years in anxious expectation of the future!</p>
<p>The guide who took us round the castle maintained that the floor was 
more worn on this spot than any where else, and that the window-sash had 
been hollowed by the elbow of the miserable king; but I could not perceive 
any difference.&nbsp; Eric was kept imprisoned here for two years, and was 
then taken to another prison.</p>
<p>There is a large picture-gallery in this castle; but it contains 
principally portraits of kings, not only of Sweden, but of other countries,
from the Middle Ages down to the present time; also portraits of ministers,
generals, painters, poets, and learned men; of celebrated Swedish females, 
who have sacrificed themselves for their country, and of the most 
celebrated female beauties.&nbsp; The name and date of birth of each person
are affixed to his or her portrait, so that each visitor may find his 
favourite without guide or catalogue.&nbsp; In many of them the colouring 
and drawing are wretched enough, but we will hope that the resemblance is 
all the more striking.</p>
<p>On our return several gentlemen were kind enough to direct my attention 
to the most interesting points of the lake.&nbsp; Among these I must 
mention Kakeholm, its broadest point; the island of Esmoi, on which a 
Swedish female gained a battle; Norsberg, also celebrated for a battle 
which took place there; and Sturrehof, the property of a great Swedish 
family.&nbsp; Near Bjarkesoe a simple cross is erected, ostensibly on the 
spot where Christianity was first introduced.&nbsp; Indeed the 
M&auml;larsee has so many historical associations, in addition to the 
attractions of its scenery, that it is one of the most interesting seas not

<h3>JOURNEY FROM STOCKHOLM TO UPSALA AND TO THE IRON-MINES OF DANEMORA</h3>
<p style="text-align: right">September 12th.</p>
<p>The intercourse between Stockholm and Upsala is very considerable.&nbsp;
A steamer leaves both places every day except Sunday, and traverses the 
distance in six hours.</p>
<p>Tempted by this convenient opportunity of easily and quickly reaching 
the celebrated town of Upsala, and by the unusually fine weather, I took my
passage one evening, and was greatly disappointed when, on the following 
morning, the rain poured down in torrents.&nbsp; But if travellers paid 
much attention to the weather, they would not go far; so I nevertheless 
embarked at half-past seven, and arrived safely in Upsala.&nbsp; I remained
in the cabin during the passage, and could not even enjoy the prospect from
the cabin-windows, for the rain beat on them from the outside, while inside
they were obscured by the heat.&nbsp; But I did not venture on deck, hoping
to be favoured by better weather on my return.</p>
<p>At last, about three o&rsquo;clock, when I had been in Upsala more than 
an hour, the weather cleared up, and I sallied out to see the sights.</p>
<p>First I visited the cathedral.&nbsp; I entered, and stood still with 
astonishment at the chief portal, on looking up at the high roof resting on
two rows of pillars, and covering the whole church.&nbsp; It is formed in 
one beautiful straight line, unbroken by a single arch.&nbsp; The church 
itself is simple: behind the grand altar a handsome chapel is erected, the 
ceiling of which is painted azure blue, embossed with golden stars.&nbsp; 
In this chapel Gustavus I. is interred between his two wives.&nbsp; The 
monument which covers the grave is large, and made of marble, but clumsy 
and void of taste.&nbsp; It represents a sarcophagus, on which three 
bodies, the size of life, are laid; a marble canopy is raised over 
them.&nbsp; The walls of the chapel are covered with pretty frescoes, 
representing the most remarkable scenes in the life of this monarch.&nbsp; 
The most interesting among them are, one in which he enters a 
peasant&rsquo;s hut in peasant&rsquo;s attire, at the same moment that his 
pursuers are eagerly inquiring after him in front of the hut; the other, 
when he stands on a barrel, also dressed as a peasant, and harangues his 
people.&nbsp; Two large tablets in a broad gold frame contain in Swedish, 
and not in the Latin language, the explanation of the different pictures, 
so that every Swede may easily learn the monarch&rsquo;s history.</p>
<p>Several other monuments are erected in the side-chapels; those of 
Catharine Magelone, John III., Gustavus Erichson, who was beheaded, and of 
the two brothers Sturre, who were murdered.&nbsp; The monument of 
Archbishop Menander, in white marble, is a tasteful and artistic modern 
production.&nbsp; The great Linn&aelig;us is buried under a simple marble 
slab in this church; but his monument is in one of the side-chapels, and 
not over his grave, and consists of a beautiful dark-brown porphyry slab, 
on which his portrait is sculptured in relief.</p>
<p>The splendid organ, which reaches nearly to the roof of the church, also
deserves special attention.&nbsp; The treasure-chamber does not contain 
great treasures; the blood-stained and dagger-torn garments of the 
unfortunate brothers Sturre are kept in a glass case here; and here also 
stands a wooden statue of the heathen god Thor.&nbsp; This wooden affair 
seems to have originally been an Ecce Homo, which was perhaps the ornament 
of some village church, then carried off by some unbeliever, and made more 
shapeless than its creator, not proficient in art, had made it.&nbsp; It 
has a greater resemblance now to a frightful scarecrow than to any thing 
else.</p>
<p>The churchyard near the church is distinguished for its size and 
beauty.&nbsp; It is surrounded by a wall of stone two feet high, surmounted
by an iron palisading of equal height, broken by stone pillars.&nbsp; On 
several sides, steps are made into the burying-ground over this 
partition.&nbsp; In this cemetery, as in the one of Stockholm, one seems to
be in a lovely garden, laid out with alleys, arbours, lawns, &amp;c.; but 
it is more beautiful than the other, because it is older.&nbsp; The graves 
are half concealed by arbours; many were ornamented with flowers and 
wreaths, or hedged by rose-bushes.&nbsp; The whole aspect of this cemetery,
or rather of this garden, seems equally adapted for the amusement of the 
living or the repose of the dead.</p>
<p>The monuments are in no way distinguished; only two are rather 
remarkable, for they consist of tremendous pieces of rock in their natural 
condition, standing upright on the graves.&nbsp; One of these monuments 
resembles a mountain; it covers the ashes of a general, and is large enough
to have covered his whole army; his relatives probably took the graves of 
Troy as a specimen for their monument.&nbsp; It is moreover inscribed by 
very peculiar signs, which seemed to me to be runic characters.&nbsp; The 
good people have united in this monument two characteristics of the 
ancients of two entirely distinct empires.</p>
<p>The university or library building in Upsala is large and beautiful; it 
is situated on a little hill, with a fine front facing the town.&nbsp; The 
park, which is, however, still somewhat young, forms the background. <a 
name="citation54"></a><a href="#footnote54" class="citation">[54]</a></p>
<p>Near this building, on the same hill, stands a royal palace, conspicuous
for its brick-red colour.&nbsp; It is very large, and the two wings are 
finished by massive round towers.</p>
<p>In the centre of the courtyard, behind the castle, is placed a colossal 
bust of Gustavus I., and a few paces from it two artificial hills serve as 
bastions, on which cannons are planted.&nbsp; This being the highest point 
of the town, affords the best view over it, and over the surrounding 
country.</p>
<p>The town itself is built half of wood and half of stone, and is very 
pretty, being crossed by broad streets, and ornamented with tastefully 
laid-out gardens.&nbsp; It has one disadvantage, which is the dark 
brownish-red colour of the houses, which has a peculiarly sombre appearance
in the setting sun.</p>
<p>An immense and fertile plain, diversified by dark forests contrasting 
with the bright green meadows and the yellow stubble-fields, surrounds the 
town, and in the distance the silvery river Fyris flows towards the 
sea.&nbsp; Forests close the distant view with their dark shadows.&nbsp; I 
saw but few villages; they may, however, have been hidden by the trees, for
that they exist seems to be indicated by the well-kept high roads crossing 
the plain in all directions.</p>
<p>Before quitting my position on the bastions of the royal palace I cast a
glance on the castle-gardens, which were lying lower down the hill, and are
separated from the castle by a road; they do not seem to be large, but are 
very pretty.</p>
<p>I should have wished to be able to visit the botanic garden near the 
town, which was the favourite resort of Linn&aelig;us, whose 
splendidly-sculptured bust is said to be its chief ornament; but the sun 
was setting behind the mountains, and I repaired to my chamber, to prepare 
for my journey to Danemora.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">September 13th.</p>
<p>I left Upsala at four o&rsquo;clock in the morning, to proceed to the 
far-famed iron-mines of Danemora, upwards of thirty miles distant, and 
where I wished to arrive before twelve, as the blasting takes place at that
hour, after which the pits are closed.&nbsp; As I had been informed how 
slowly travelling is done in this country, and how tedious the delays are 
when the horses are changed, I determined to allow time enough for all 
interruptions, and yet arrive at the appointed hour.</p>
<p>A few miles behind Upsala lies Old Upsala (Gamla Upsala).&nbsp; I saw 
the old church and the grave-hills in passing; three of the latter are 
remarkably large, the others smaller.&nbsp; It is presumed that the higher 
ones cover the graves of kings.&nbsp; I saw similar tumuli during my 
journey to Greece, on the spot where Troy is said to have stood.&nbsp; The 
church is not honoured as a ruin; it has yet to do service; and it grieved 
me to see the venerable building propped up and covered with fresh mortar 
on many a time-worn spot.</p>
<p>Half way between Upsala and Danemora we passed a large castle, not 
distinguished for its architecture, its situation, or any thing else.&nbsp;
Then we neared the river Fyris, and the long lake of Danemora; both are 
quite overgrown with reeds and grass, and have flat uninteresting shores; 
indeed the whole journey offers little variety, as the road lies through a 
plain, only diversified by woods, fields, and pieces of rock.&nbsp; These 
are interesting features, because one cannot imagine how they came there, 
the mountains being at a great distance, and the soil by no means 
rocky.</p>
<p>The little town of Danemora lies in the midst of a wood, and only 
consists of a church and a few large and small detached houses.&nbsp; The 
vicinity of the mines is indicated before arriving at the place by immense 
heaps of stones, which are brought by horse-gins from the pits, and which 
cover a considerable space.</p>
<p>I had fortunately arrived in time to see the blastings.&nbsp; Those in 
the great pit are the most interesting; for its mouth is so very large, 
that it is not necessary to descend in order to see the pit-men work; all 
is visible from above.&nbsp; This is a very peculiar and interesting 
sight.&nbsp; The pit, 480 feet deep, with its colossal doors and entrances 
leading into the galleries, looks like a picture of the lower world, from 
which bridges of rocks, projections, arches and caverns formed in the 
walls, ascend to the upper world.&nbsp; The men look like pigmies, and one 
cannot follow their movements until the eye has accustomed itself to the 
depth and to the darkness prevailing below.&nbsp; But the darkness is not 
very dense; I could distinguish most of the ladders, which seemed to me 
like children&rsquo;s toys.</p>
<p>It was nearly twelve, and the workmen left the pits, with the exception 
of those in charge of the mines.&nbsp; They ascended by means of little 
tubs hanging by ropes, and were raised by a windlass.&nbsp; It is a 
terrible sight to see the men soaring up on the little machine, especially 
when two or three ascend at once; for then one man stands in the centre, 
while the other two ride on the edge of the tub.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p244b.jpg">
<img alt="Mines of Danemora" src="images/p244s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>I should have liked to descend into the great pit, but it was too late 
on this day, and I would not wait another.&nbsp; I should not have feared 
the descent, as I was familiar with such adventures, having explored the 
salt-mines of Wieliczka and Bochnia, in Gallicia, some years before, in 
which I had had to let myself down by a rope, which is a much more 
dangerous method than the tub.</p>
<p>With the stroke of twelve, four blasting trains in the large pit were 
fired.&nbsp; The man whose business it was to apply the match ran away in 
great haste, and sheltered himself behind a wall of rock.&nbsp; In a few 
moments the powder flashed, some stones fell, and then a fearful crash was 
heard all around, followed by the rolling and falling of the blasted 
masses.&nbsp; Repeated echoes announced the fearful explosion in the 
interior of the pits: the whole left a terrible impression on me.&nbsp; 
Scarcely had one mine ceased to rage, when the second began, then the 
third, and so on.&nbsp; These blastings take place daily in different 
mines.</p>
<p>The other pits are deeper, the deepest being 600 feet; but the mouths 
are smaller, and the shafts not perpendicular, so that the eye is lost in 
darkness, which is a still more unpleasant sensation.&nbsp; I gazed with 
oppressed chest into the dark space, vainly endeavouring to distinguish 
something.&nbsp; I should not like to be a miner; I could not endure life 
without the light of day; and when I turned from the dark pits, I cast my 
eyes thankfully on the cheerful landscape basking in the sun.</p>
<p>I returned to Upsala on the same day, having made this little journey by
post.&nbsp; I can merely narrate the facts, without giving an opinion on 
the good or bad conveniences for locomotion, as this was more a 
pleasure-trip than a journey.</p>
<p>As I had hired no carriage, I had a different vehicle at every station, 
and these vehicles consisted of ordinary two-wheeled wooden carts.&nbsp; My
seat was a truss of hay covered with the horse-cloth.&nbsp; If the roads 
had not been so extremely good, these carts would have shaken terribly; but
as it was, I must say that I rode more comfortably than in the carriols of 
the Norwegians, although they were painted and vanished; for in them I had 
to be squeezed in with my feet stretched out, and could not change my 
position.</p>
<p>The stations are unequal,&mdash;sometimes long, sometimes short.&nbsp; 
The post-horses are provided here, as in Norway, by wealthy peasants, 
called Dschns-peasants.&nbsp; These have to collect a certain number of 
horses every evening for forwarding the travellers the next morning.&nbsp; 
At every post-house a book is kept, in which the traveller can see how many
horses the peasant has, how many have already been hired, and how many are 
left in the stable.&nbsp; He must then inscribe his name, the hour of his 
departure, and the number of horses he requires.&nbsp; By this arrangement 
deception and extortion are prevented, as every thing is open, and the 
prices fixed. <a name="citation55"></a><a href="#footnote55" 
class="citation">[55]</a></p>
<p>Patience is also required here, though not so much as in Norway.&nbsp; I
had always to wait from fifteen to twenty minutes before the carriage was 
brought and the horses and harness prepared, but never longer; and I must 
admit that the Swedish post-masters hurried as much as possible, and never 
demanded double fare, although they must have known that I was in 
haste.&nbsp; The pace of the horse depends on the will of the coachman and 
the powers of his steed; but in no other country did I see such 
consideration paid to the strength of the horses.&nbsp; It is quite 
ridiculous to see what small loads of corn, bricks, or wood, are allotted 
to two horses, and how slowly and sleepily they draw their burdens.</p>
<p>The number of wooden gates, which divide the roads into as many parts as
there are common grounds on it, are a terrible nuisance to 
travellers.&nbsp; The coachman has often to dismount six or eight times in 
an hour to open and close these gates.&nbsp; I was told that these 
delectable gates even exist on the great high road, only not quite in such 
profusion as on the by-roads.</p>
<p>Wood must be as abundant here as in Norway, for every thing is enclosed;
even fields which seem so barren as not to be worth the labour or the 
wood.</p>
<p>The villages through which I passed were generally pretty and cheerful, 
and I found the cottages, which I entered while the horses were changed, 
neatly and comfortably furnished.</p>
<p>The peasants of this district wear a peculiar costume.&nbsp; The men, 
and frequently also the boys, wear long dark-blue cloth surtouts, and cloth
caps on their heads; so that, at a distance, they look like gentlemen in 
travelling dress.&nbsp; It seems curious to a foreigner to see these 
apparent gentlemen following the plough or cutting grass.&nbsp; At a nearer
view, of course the aspect changes, and the rents and dirt appear, or the 
leathern apron worn beneath the coat, like carpenters in Austria, becomes 
visible.&nbsp; The female costume was peculiar only in so far that it was 
poor and ragged.&nbsp; In dress and shoes the Norwegian and Swedes are 
behind the Icelanders, but they surpass them in the comfort of their 
dwellings.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">September 14th.</p>
<p>To-day I returned to Stockholm on the M&auml;larsee, and the weather 
being more favourable than on my former passage, I could remain on deck the
whole time.&nbsp; I saw now that we sailed for several miles on the river 
Fyris, which flows through woods and fields into the lake.</p>
<p>The large plain on which old and new Upsala lie was soon out of sight, 
and after passing two bridges, we turned into the M&auml;lar.&nbsp; At 
first there are no islands on its flat expanse, and its shores are studded 
with low tree-covered hills; but we soon, however, arrived at the region of
islands, where the passage becomes more interesting, and the beauty of the 
shores increases.&nbsp; The first fine view we saw was the pretty estate 
Krusenberg, whose castle is romantically situated on a fertile hill.&nbsp; 
But much more beautiful and surprising is the splendid castle of 
Skukloster, a large, beautiful, and regular pile, ornamented with four 
immense round turrets at the four corners, and with gardens stretching down
to the water&rsquo;s edge.</p>
<p>From this place the scenery is full of beauty and variety; every moment 
presents another and a more lovely view.&nbsp; Sometimes the waters expand,
sometimes they are hemmed in by islands, and become as narrow as 
canals.&nbsp; I was most charmed with those spots where the islands lie so 
close together that no outlet seems possible, till another turn shews an 
opening between them, with a glimpse of the lake beyond.&nbsp; The hills on
the shores are higher, and the promontories larger, the farther the ship 
advances; and the islands appear to be merely projections of the continent,
till a nearer approach dispels the illusion.</p>
<p>The village of Sixtun&auml; lies in a picturesque and charming little 
valley, filled with ruins, principally of round towers, which are said to 
be the remains of the Roman town of Sixtum; the name being retained by the 
new town with a slight modification.</p>
<p>After this follow cliffs and rocks rising perpendicularly from the sea, 
and whose vicinity would be by no means desirable in a storm.&nbsp; Of the 
castle of Rouse only three beautiful domes rise above the trees; a frowning
bleak hill conceals the rest from the eye.&nbsp; Then comes a palace, the 
property of a private individual, only remarkable for its size.&nbsp; The 
last of the notabilities is the Rokeby bridge, said to be one of the 
longest in Sweden.&nbsp; It unites the firm land with the island on which 
the royal castle of Drottingholm stands.&nbsp; The town of Stockholm now 
becomes visible; we turn into the portion of the lake on which it lies, and
arrive there again at two o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>FROM STOCKHOLM TO TRAVEMUNDE AND HAMBURGH</h3>
<p>I bade farewell to Stockholm on the 18th September, and embarked in the 
steamer <i>Svithiold</i>, of 100-horse power, at twelve o&rsquo;clock at 
noon, to go to Travem&uuml;nde.</p>
<p>Few passages can be more expensive than this one is.&nbsp; The distance 
is five hundred leagues, and the journey generally occupies two and a half 
to three days; for this the fare, without food, is four pounds.&nbsp; The 
food is also exorbitantly dear; in addition to which the captain is the 
purveyor; so that there is no appeal for the grossest extortion or 
insufficiency.</p>
<p>It pained me much when one of the poorer travellers, who suffered 
greatly from sea-sickness, having applied for some soup to the steward, who
referred him to the amiable captain, to hear him declare he would make no 
exception, and that a basin of soup would be charged the whole price of a 
complete dinner.&nbsp; The poor man was to do without the soup, of which he
stood so much in need, or scrape every farthing together to pay a few 
shillings daily for his dinner.&nbsp; Fortunately for him some benevolent 
persons on deck paid for his meals.&nbsp; Some of the gentlemen brought 
their own wine with them, for which they had to pay as much duty to the 
captain as the wine was worth.</p>
<p>To these pleasures of travelling must be added the fact, that a Swedish 
vessel does not advance at all if the weather is unfavourable.&nbsp; Most 
of the passengers considered that the engines were inefficient.&nbsp; 
However this may be, we were delayed twenty-four hours at the first half of
our journey, from Stockholm to Calmar, although we had only a slight breeze
against us and a rather high sea, but no storm.&nbsp; In Calmar we cast 
anchor, and waited for more favourable wind.&nbsp; Several gentlemen, whose
business in Lubeck was pressing, left the steamer, and continued their 
journey by land.</p>
<p>At first the Baltic very much resembles the M&auml;larsee; for islands, 
rocks, and a variety of scenery make it interesting.&nbsp; To the right we 
saw the immensely long wooden bridge of Lindenborg, which unites one of the
larger islands with the continent.</p>
<p>At the end of one of the turns of the sea lies the town of Wachsholm; 
and opposite to it, upon a little rocky island, a splendid fortress with a 
colossal round tower.&nbsp; Judging by the number of cannons planted along 
the walls, this fortress must be of great importance.&nbsp; A few hours 
later we passed a similar fortress, Friedrichsborg; it is not in such an 
open situation as the other, but is more surrounded by forests.&nbsp; We 
passed at a considerable distance, and could not see much of it, nor of the
castle lying on the opposite side, which seems to be very magnificent, and 
is also surrounded by woods.</p>
<p>The boundaries of the right shore now disappear, but then again appear 
as a terrible heap of naked rocks, at whose extreme edge is situated the 
fine fortress Dolero.&nbsp; Near it groups of houses are built on the bare 
rocks projecting into the sea, and form an extensive town.</p>
<p>September 19th.</p>
<p>To-day we were on the open, somewhat stormy sea.&nbsp; Towards noon we 
arrived at the Calmar Sound, formed by the flat, uniform shores of the long
island Oland on the left, and on the right by Schmoland.&nbsp; In front 
rose the mountain-island the Jungfrau, to which every Swede points with 
self-satisfied pride.&nbsp; Its height is only remarkable compared with the
flatness around; beside the proud giant-mountain of the same name in 
Switzerland it would seem like a little hill.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">September 20th.</p>
<p>On account of the contrary wind, we had cast anchor here last night, and
this morning continued the journey to Calmar, where we arrived about two in
the forenoon.&nbsp; The town is situated on an immense plain, and is not 
very interesting.&nbsp; A few hours may be agreeably spent here in visiting
the beautiful church and the antiquated castle, and we had more than enough
leisure for it.&nbsp; Wind and weather seemed to have conspired against us,
and the captain announced an indefinite stay at this place.&nbsp; At first 
we could not land, as the waves were too high; but at last one of the 
larger boats came alongside, and the more curious among us ventured to row 
to the land in the unsteady vessel.</p>
<p>The exterior of the church resembles a fine antiquated castle from its 
four corner towers and the lowness of its dome, which rises very little 
above the building, and also because the other turrets here and there 
erected for ornament are scarcely perceptible.&nbsp; The interior of the 
church is remarkable for its size, its height, and a particularly fine 
echo.&nbsp; The tones of the organ are said to produce a most striking 
effect.&nbsp; We sent for the organist, but he was nowhere to be found; so 
we had to content ourselves with the echo of our own voices.&nbsp; We went 
from this place to the old royal castle built by Queen Margaret in the 
sixteenth century.&nbsp; The castle is so dilapidated inside that a 
tarrying in the upper chambers is scarcely advisable.&nbsp; The lower rooms
of the castle have been repaired, and are used as prisons; and as we 
passed, arms were stretched forth from some of the barred windows, and 
plaintive voices entreated the passers-by to bestow some trifle upon the 
poor inmates.&nbsp; Upwards of 140 prisoners are said to be confined here. 
<a name="citation56"></a><a href="#footnote56" 
class="citation">[56]</a></p>
<p>About three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon the wind abated, and we 
continued our journey.&nbsp; The passage is very uniform, and we saw only 
flat, bare shores; a group of trees even was a rarity.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">September 21st.</p>
<p>When I came on deck this morning the Sound was far behind us.&nbsp; To 
the left we had the open sea; on the right, instead of the bleak Schmoland,
we had the bleaker Schonen, which was so barren, that we hardly saw a 
paltry fishing-village between the low sterile hills.</p>
<p>At nine o&rsquo;clock in the morning we anchored in the port of 
Ystadt.&nbsp; The town is pretty, and has a large square, in which stand 
the house of the governor, the theatre, and the town-hall.&nbsp; The 
streets are broad, and the houses partly of wood and partly of stone.&nbsp;
The most interesting feature is the ancient church, and in it a 
much-damaged wooden altar-piece, which is kept in the vestry.&nbsp; Though 
the figures are coarse and disproportionate, one must admire the 
composition and the carving.&nbsp; The reliefs on the pulpit, and a 
beautiful monument to the right of the altar, also deserve 
admiration.&nbsp; These are all carved in wood.</p>
<p>In the afternoon we passed the Danish island Malm&ouml;.</p>
<p>At last, after having been nearly four days on the sea instead of two 
days and a half, we arrived safely in the harbour of Travem&uuml;nde on the
22d September at two o&rsquo;clock in the morning.&nbsp; And now my 
sea-journeys were over; I parted sorrowfully from the salt waters, for it 
is so delightful to see the water&rsquo;s expanse all around, and traverse 
its mirror-like surface.&nbsp; The sea presents a beautiful picture, even 
when it storms and rages, when waves tower upon waves, and threaten to dash
the vessel to pieces or to engulf it&mdash;when the ship alternately dances
on their points, or shoots into the abyss; and I frequently crept for hours
in a corner, or held fast to the sides of the ship, and let the waves dash 
over me.&nbsp; I had overcome the terrible sea-sickness during my numerous 
journeys, and could therefore freely admire these fearfully beautiful 
scenes of excited nature, and adore God in His grandest works.</p>
<p>We had scarcely cast anchor in the port when a whole array of coachmen 
surrounded us, volunteering to drive us overland to Hamburgh, a journey of 
thirty-six miles, which it takes eight hours to accomplish.</p>
<p>Travem&uuml;nde is a pretty spot, which really consists of only one 
street, in which the majority of the houses are hotels.&nbsp; The country 
from here to Lubeck, a distance of ten miles, is very pretty.&nbsp; A 
splendid road, on which the carriages roll smoothly along, runs through a 
charming wood past a cemetery, whose beauty exceeds that of Upsala; but for
the monuments, one might take it for one of the most splendid parks or 
gardens.</p>
<p>I regretted nothing so much as being unable to spend a day in Lubeck, 
for I felt very much attracted by this old Hanse town, with its 
pyramidically-built houses, its venerable dome, and other beautiful 
churches, its spacious squares, &amp;c.; but I was obliged to proceed, and 
could only gaze at and admire it as I hurried through.&nbsp; The pavement 
of the streets is better than I had seen it in any northern town; and on 
the streets, in front of the houses, I saw many wooden benches, on which 
the inhabitants probably spend their summer evenings.&nbsp; I saw here for 
the first time again the gay-looking street-mirrors used in Hamburgh.&nbsp;
The Trave, which flows between Travem&uuml;nde and Lubeck, has to be 
crossed by boat.&nbsp; Near Oldesloe are the salt-factories, with large 
buildings and immensely high chimneys; an old romantic castle, entirely 
surrounded by water, lies near Arensburg.</p>
<p>Past Arensburg the country begins to be uninteresting, and remains so as
far as Hamburgh; but it seems to be very fertile, as there is an abundance 
of green fields and fine meadows.</p>
<p>The little journey from Lubeck to Hamburgh is rather dear, on account of
the almost incredible number of tolls and dues the poor coachmen have to 
pay.&nbsp; They have first to procure a license to drive from Lubeck into 
Hamburgh territory, which costs about 1<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>; then mine had 
to pay twice a double toll of 8<i>d.</i>, because we passed through before 
five o&rsquo;clock in the morning, and the gates, which are not opened till
five o&rsquo;clock, were unfastened especially for us; besides these, there
was a penny toll on nearly every mile.</p>
<p>This dreadful annoyance of the constant stopping and the toll-bars is 
unknown in Norway and in Sweden.&nbsp; There, an annual tax is paid for 
every horse, and the owner can then drive freely through the whole country,
as no toll-bars are erected.</p>
<p>The farm-houses here are very large and far-spread, but the reason is, 
that stable, barn, and shippen are under the same roof: the walls of the 
houses are of wood filled in with bricks.</p>
<p>After passing Arensburg, we saw the steeples of Wandsbeck and Hamburgh 
in the distance; the two towns seem to be one, and are, in fact, only 
separated by pretty country-houses.&nbsp; But Wandsbeck compared to 
Hamburgh is a village, not a town.</p>
<p>I arrived in Hamburgh about two o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon; and my 
relatives were so astonished at my arrival, that they almost took me for a 
ghost.&nbsp; I was at first startled by their reception, but soon 
understood the reason of it.</p>
<p>At the time I left Iceland another vessel went to Altona, by which I 
sent a box of minerals and curiosities to my cousin in Hamburgh.&nbsp; The 
sailor who brought the box gave such a description of the wretched vessel 
in which I had gone to Copenhagen, that, after having heard nothing of me 
for two months, he thought I must have gone to the bottom of the sea with 
the ship.&nbsp; I had indeed written from Copenhagen, but the letter had 
been lost; and hence their surprise and delight at my arrival.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<p>I had not much time to spare, so that I could only stay a few days with 
my relatives in Hamburgh; on the 26th September, I went in a little steamer
from Hamburgh to Harburg, where we arrived in three quarters of an 
hour.&nbsp; From thence I proceeded in a stage-carriage to Celle, about 
sixty-five miles.</p>
<p>The country is not very interesting; it consists for the most part of 
plains, which degenerate into heaths and marshes; but there are a few 
fertile spots peeping out here and there.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">September 27th.</p>
<p>We arrived at Celle in the night.&nbsp; From here to Lehrte, a distance 
of about seven miles, I had to hire a private conveyance, but from Lehrte 
the railway goes direct to Berlin. <a name="citation57"></a><a 
href="#footnote57" class="citation">[57]</a>&nbsp; Many larger and smaller 
towns are passed on this road; but we saw little of them, as the stations 
all lie at some distance, and the railway-train only stops a few 
minutes.</p>
<p>The first town we passed was Brunswick.&nbsp; Immediately beyond the 
town lies the pretty ducal palace, built in the Gothic style, in the centre
of a fine park.&nbsp; Wolfenb&uuml;ttel seems to be a considerable town, 
judging by the quantity of houses and church-steeples.&nbsp; A pretty 
wooden bridge, with an elegantly-made iron balustrade, is built here across
the Ocker.&nbsp; From the town, a beautiful lane leads to a gentle hill, on
whose top stands a lovely building, used as a coffee-house.</p>
<p>As soon as one has passed the Hanoverian domains the country, though it 
is not richer in natural curiosities, is less abundant in marshes and 
heaths, and is very well-cultivated land.&nbsp; Many villages are spread 
around, and many a charming town excites the wish to travel through at a 
slower pace.</p>
<p>We passed Schepenstadt, Jersheim, and Wegersleben, which latter town 
already belongs to Prussia.&nbsp; In Ashersleben and in Magdeburg we 
changed carriages.&nbsp; Near Salze we saw some fine buildings which belong
to the extensive saltworks existing here.&nbsp; Jernaudau is a colony of 
Moravians.&nbsp; I should have wished to visit the town of 
K&ouml;tten,&mdash;for nothing can be more charming than the situation of 
the town in the midst of fragrant gardens,&mdash;but we unfortunately only 
stopped there a few minutes.&nbsp; The town of Dessau is also surrounded by
pretty scenery: several bridges cross the various arms of the Elbe; that 
over the river itself rests on solid stone columns.&nbsp; Of Wittenberg we 
only saw house tops and church-steeples; the same of J&uuml;terbog, which 
looks as if it were newly built.&nbsp; Near Lukewalde the regions of sand 
begin, and the uniformity is only broken by a little ridge of wooded hills 
near Trebbin; but when these are past, the railway passes on to Berlin 
through a melancholy, unmitigated desert of sand.</p>
<p>I had travelled from six o&rsquo;clock this morning until seven in the 
evening, over a distance of about two hundred and twenty miles, during 
which time we had frequently changed carriages.</p>
<p>The number of passengers we had taken up on the road was very great, on 
account of the Leipzic fairs; sometimes the train had thirty-five to forty 
carriages, three locomotives, and seven to eight hundred passengers; and 
yet the greatest order had prevailed.&nbsp; It is a great convenience that 
one can take a ticket from Lehrte to Berlin, although the railway passes 
through so many different states, because then one needs not look after the
luggage or any thing else.&nbsp; The officials on the railway are all very 
civil.&nbsp; As soon as the train stopped, the guards announced with a loud
voice the time allowed, however long or short it might be; so that the 
passengers could act accordingly, and take refreshments in the neighbouring
hotels.&nbsp; The arrangements for alighting are very convenient: the 
carriages run into deep rails at the stations, so that the ground is level 
with the carriages, and the entrance and exit easy.&nbsp; The carriages are
like broad coaches; two seats ran breadthwise across them, with a large 
door at each side.&nbsp; The first and second class contain eight persons 
in each division, the third class ten.&nbsp; The carriages are all 
numbered, so that every passenger can easily find his seat.</p>
<p>By these simple arrangements the traveller may descend and walk about a 
little, even though the train should only stop two minutes, or even 
purchase some refreshments, without any confusion or crowding.</p>
<p>These conveniences are, of course, impossible when the carriages have 
the length of a house, and contain sixty or seventy persons within locked 
doors, and where the doors are opened by the guards, who only call out the 
name of the station without announcing how long the stay is.&nbsp; In such 
railways it is not advisable for travellers to leave their seats; for 
before they can pass from one end of the carriage to the other, through the
narrow door and down the steep steps, the horn is sounded, and at the same 
time the train moves on; the sound being the signal for the engine-driver, 
the passengers having none.</p>
<p>In these states there was also not the least trouble with the passport 
and the intolerable pass-tickets.&nbsp; No officious police-soldier comes 
to the carriage, and prevents the passengers alighting before they have 
answered all his questions.&nbsp; If passports had to be inspected on this 
journey, it would take a few days, for they must always be taken to the 
passport-office, as they are never examined on the spot.</p>
<p>Such annoying interruptions often occur several times in the same 
state.&nbsp; And one need not even come from abroad to experience them, as 
a journey from a provincial to a capital town affords enough scope for 
annoyance.</p>
<p>I had no reason to complain of such annoyances in any of the countries 
through which I had hitherto passed.&nbsp; My passport was only demanded in
my hotel in the capitals of the countries, if I intended to remain several 
days.&nbsp; In Stockholm, however, I found a curious arrangement; every 
foreigner there is obliged to procure a Swedish passport, and pay 
half-a-crown for it, if he only remains a few hours in the town.&nbsp; This
is, in reality, only a polite way of taking half-a-crown from the 
strangers, as they probably do not like to charge so much for a simple 
<i>vis&eacute;</i>!</p>
<h3>STAY IN BERLIN&mdash;RETURN TO VIENNA</h3>
<p>I have never seen a town more beautifully or regularly built than 
Berlin,&mdash;I mean, the town of Berlin itself,&mdash;only the finest 
streets, palaces, and squares of Copenhagen would bear a comparison with 
it.</p>
<p>I spent but a few days here, and had therefore scarcely time to see the 
most remarkable and interesting sights.</p>
<p>The splendid royal palace, the extensive buildings for the 
picture-gallery and museums, the great dome&mdash;all these are situated 
very near each other.</p>
<p>The Dome church is large and regularly built; a chapel, surrounded by an
iron enclosure, stands at each side of the entrance.&nbsp; Several kings 
are buried here, and antiquated sarcophagi cover their remains, known as 
the kings&rsquo; graves.&nbsp; Near them stands a fine cast-iron monument, 
beneath which Count Brandenburg lies.</p>
<p>The Catholic church is built in the style of the Rotunda in Rome; but, 
unlike it, the light falls from windows made around the walls, and not from
above.&nbsp; Beautiful statues and a simple but tasteful altar are the only
ornaments of this church.&nbsp; The portico is ornamented by beautiful 
reliefs.</p>
<p>The Werder church is a modern erection, built in the Gothic style, and 
its turrets are ornamented by beautiful bronze reliefs.&nbsp; The walls 
inside are inlaid with coloured wood up to the galleries, where they 
terminate in Gothic scroll-work.&nbsp; The organ has a full, clear tone; in
front of it stands a painting which, at first sight, resembles a scene from
heathen mythology more than a sacred subject.&nbsp; A number of cupids soar
among wreaths of flowers, and surround three beautiful female figures.</p>
<p>The mint and the architectural college stand near this church.&nbsp; The
former is covered with fine sculptures; the latter is square, of a 
brick-red colour, without any architectural embellishment, and perfectly 
resembling an unusually large private house.&nbsp; The ground-floor is 
turned into fine shops.</p>
<p>Near the palace lies the Opera Square, in which stand the celebrated 
opera-house, the arsenal, the university, the library, the academy, the 
guardhouse, and several royal palaces.&nbsp; Three statues ornament the 
square: those of General Count B&uuml;lov, General Count Scharnhorst, and 
General Prince Bl&uuml;cher.&nbsp; They are all three beautifully 
sculptured, but the drapery did not please me; it consisted of the long 
military cloth cloak, which, opening in front, afforded a glimpse of the 
splendid uniforms.</p>
<p>The arsenal is one of the finest buildings in Berlin, and forms a 
square; at the time of my stay some repairs were being made, so that it was
closed.&nbsp; I had to be content with glimpses through the windows of the 
first floor, which showed me immense saloons filled by tremendous cannons, 
ranged in rows.</p>
<p>The guardhouse is contiguous, and resembles a pretty temple, with its 
portico of columns.</p>
<p>The opera-house forms a long detached square.&nbsp; It would have a much
better effect if the entrances were not so wretched.&nbsp; The one at the 
grand portal looks like a narrow, miserable church-door, low and 
gloomy.&nbsp; The other entrances are worse still, and one would not 
suppose that they could lead to such a splendid interior, whose 
appointments are indescribably luxurious and commodious.&nbsp; The pit is 
filled by rows of comfortably-cushioned chairs with cushioned backs, 
numbered, but not barred.&nbsp; The boxes are divided by very low 
partitions, so that the aristocratic world seems to sit on a tribune.&nbsp;
The seats in the pit and the first and second tiers are covered with 
dark-red silk damask; the royal box is a splendid saloon, the floor of 
which is covered with the finest carpets.&nbsp; Beautiful oil-paintings, in
tasteful gold frames, ornament the plafond; but the magnificent chandelier 
is the greatest curiosity.&nbsp; It looks so massively worked in bronze, 
that it is painful to see the heavy mass hang so loosely over the heads of 
the spectators.&nbsp; But it is only a delusion; for it is made of 
paste-board, and bronzed over.&nbsp; Innumerable lamps light the place; but
one thing which I miss in such elegant modern theatres is a clock, which 
has a place in nearly every Italian theatre.</p>
<p>The other buildings on this square are also distinguished for their size
and the beauty of their architecture.</p>
<p>An unusually broad stone bridge, with a finely-made iron balustrade, is 
built over a little arm of the Spree, and unites the square of the opera 
with that on which the palace stands.</p>
<p>The royal museum is one of the finest architectural piles, and its high 
portal is covered with beautiful frescoes.&nbsp; The picture-gallery 
contains many <i>chefs-d&rsquo;oeuvre</i>; and I regretted that I had not 
more time to examine it and the hall of antiquities, having only three 
hours for the two.</p>
<p>From the academy runs a long street lined with lime-trees, and which is 
therefore called Under-the-limes (<i>unter den Linden</i>).&nbsp; This 
alley forms a cheerful walk to the Brandenburg-gate, beyond which the 
pleasure-gardens are situated.&nbsp; The longest and finest streets which 
run into the lime-alley are the Friedrichs Street and the Wilhelms 
Street.&nbsp; The Leipziger Street also belongs to the finest, but does not
run into this promenade.</p>
<p>The Gens-d&rsquo;arme Square is distinguished by the French and German 
churches, at least by their exterior,&mdash;by their high domes, columns, 
and porticoes.&nbsp; The interiors are small and insignificant.&nbsp; On 
this square stands also the royal theatre, a tasteful pile of great beauty,
with many pillars, and statues of muses and deities.</p>
<p>I ascended the tower on which the telegraph works, on account of the 
view over the town and the flat neighbourhood.&nbsp; A very civil official 
was polite enough to explain the signs of the telegraph to me, and to 
permit me to look at the other telegraphs through his telescope.</p>
<p>The K&ouml;nigstadt, situated on the opposite shore of the Spree, not 
far from the royal palace, contains nothing remarkable.&nbsp; Its chief 
street, the K&ouml;nigsstrasse, is long, but narrow and dirty.&nbsp; Indeed
it forms a great contrast to the town of Berlin in every thing; the streets
are narrow, short, and winding.&nbsp; The post-office and the theatres are 
the most remarkable buildings.</p>
<p>The luxury displayed in the shop-windows is very great.&nbsp; Many a 
mirror and many a plate-glass window reminded me of Hamburgh&rsquo;s 
splendour, which surpasses that of Berlin considerably.</p>
<p>There are not many excursions round Berlin, as the country is flat and 
sandy.&nbsp; The most interesting are to the pleasure-gardens, 
Charlottenburg, and, since the opening of the railway, to Potsdam.</p>
<p>The park or pleasure-garden is outside the Brandenburg-gate; it is 
divided into several parts, one of which reminded me of our fine Prater in 
Vienna.&nbsp; The beautiful alleys were filled with carriages, riders, and 
pedestrians; pretty coffee-houses enlivened the woody portions, and merry 
children gambolled on the green lawns.&nbsp; I felt so much reminded of my 
beloved Prater, that I expected every moment to see a well-known face, or 
receive a friendly greeting.&nbsp; Kroll&rsquo;s Casino, sometimes called 
the Winter-garden, is built on this side of the park.&nbsp; I do not know 
how to describe this building; it is quite a fairy palace.&nbsp; All the 
splendour which fancy can invent in furniture, gilding, painting, or 
tapestry, is here united in the splendid halls, saloons, temples, 
galleries, and boxes.&nbsp; The dining-room, which will dine 1800 persons, 
is not lighted by windows, but by a glass roof vaulted over it.&nbsp; Rows 
of pillars support the galleries, or separate the larger and smaller 
saloons.&nbsp; In the niches, and in the corners, round the pillars, abound
fragrant flowers, and plants in chaste vases or pots, which transform this 
place into a magical garden in winter.&nbsp; Concerts and 
<i>r&eacute;unions</i> take place here every Sunday, and the press of 
visitors is extraordinary, although smoking is prohibited.&nbsp; This place
will accommodate 5000 persons.</p>
<p>That side of the park which lies in the direction of the Potsdam-gate 
resembles an ornamental garden, with its well-kept alleys, flower-beds, 
terraces, islets, and gold-fish ponds.&nbsp; A handsome monument to the 
memory of Queen Louise is erected on the Louise island here.</p>
<p>On this side, the coffee-house Odeon is the best, but cannot be compared
to Kroll&rsquo;s casino.&nbsp; Here also are rows of very elegant 
country-houses, most of which are built in the Italian style.</p>
<h3>CHARLOTTENBURG</h3>
<p>This place is about half an hour&rsquo;s distance from the 
Brandenburg-gate, where the omnibuses that depart every minute are 
stationed.&nbsp; The road leads through the park, beyond which lies a 
pretty village, and adjoining it is the royal country-palace of 
Charlottenburg.&nbsp; The palace is built in two stories, of which the 
upper one is very low, and is probably only used for the domestics.&nbsp; 
The palace is more broad than deep; the roof is terrace-shaped, and in its 
centre rises a pretty dome.&nbsp; The garden is simple, and not very large,
but contains a considerable orangery.&nbsp; In a dark grove stands a little
building, the mausoleum in which the image of Queen Louise has been 
excellently executed by the famed artist Rauch.&nbsp; Here also rest the 
ashes of the late king.&nbsp; There is also an island with statues in the 
midst of a large pond, on which some swans float proudly.&nbsp; It is a 
pity that dirt does not stick to these white-feathered animals, else they 
would soon be black swans; for the pond or river surrounding the island is 
one of the dirtiest ditches I have ever seen.</p>
<p>Fatigue would be very intolerable in this park, for there are very few 
benches, but an immense quantity of gnats.</p>
<h3>POTSDAM.</h3>
<p>The distance from Berlin to Potsdam is eighteen miles, which is passed 
by the railroad in three-quarters of an hour.&nbsp; The railway is very 
conveniently arranged; the carriages are marked with the names of the 
station, and the traveller enters the carriage on which the place of his 
destination is marked.&nbsp; Thus, the passengers are never annoyed by the 
entrance or exit of passengers, as all occupying the same carriage descend 
at the same time.</p>
<p>The road is very uninteresting; but this is compensated for by Potsdam 
itself, for which a day is scarcely sufficient.</p>
<p>Immediately in front of the town flows the river Havel, crossed by a 
long, beautiful bridge, whose pillars are of stone, and the rest of the 
bridge of iron.&nbsp; The large royal palace lies on the opposite shore, 
and is surrounded by a garden.&nbsp; The garden is not very extensive, but 
large enough for the town, and is open to the public.&nbsp; The palace is 
built in a splendid style, but is unfortunately quite useless, as the court
has beautiful summer-palaces in the neighbourhood of Potsdam, and spends 
the winter in Berlin.</p>
<p>The castle square is not very good; it is neither large nor regular, and
not even level.&nbsp; On it stands the large church, which is not yet 
completed, but promises to be a fine structure.&nbsp; The town is tolerably
large, and has many fine houses.&nbsp; The streets, especially the Nauner 
Street, are wide and long, but badly paved; the stones are laid with the 
pointed side upwards, and for foot-passengers there is a stone pavement two
feet broad on one side of the street only.&nbsp; The promenade of the 
townspeople is called Am Kanal (beside the canal), and is a fine square, 
through which the canal flows, and is ornamented with trees.</p>
<p>Of the royal pleasure-palaces I visited that of Sans Souci first.&nbsp; 
It is surrounded by a pretty park, and lies on a hill, which is divided 
into six terraces.&nbsp; Large conservatories stand on each side of these; 
and in front of them are long alleys of orange and lemon-trees.</p>
<p>The palace has only a ground floor, and is surrounded by arbours, trees,
and vines, so that it is almost concealed from view.&nbsp; I could not 
inspect the interior, as the royal family was living there.</p>
<p>A side-path leads from here to the Ruinenberg, on which the ruins of a 
larger and a smaller temple, raised by the hand of art, are tastefully 
disposed.&nbsp; The top of the hill is taken up by a reservoir of 
water.&nbsp; From this point one can see the back of the palace of Sans 
Souci, and the so-called new palace, separated from the former by a small 
park, and distant only about a quarter of an hour.</p>
<p>The new palace, built by Frederick the Great, is as splendid as one can 
imagine.&nbsp; It forms a lengthened square, with arabesques and flat 
columns, and has a flat roof, which is surrounded by a stone balustrade, 
and ornamented by statues.</p>
<p>The apartments are high and large, and splendidly painted, tapestried, 
and furnished.&nbsp; Oil-paintings, many of them very good, cover the 
walls.&nbsp; One might fill a volume with the description of all the 
wonders of this place, which is, however, not inhabited.</p>
<p>Behind the palace, and separated from it by a large court, are two 
beautiful little palaces, connected by a crescent-shaped hall of pillars; 
broad stone steps lead to the balconies surrounding the first story of the 
edifices.&nbsp; They are used as barracks, and are, as such, the most 
beautiful I have ever seen.</p>
<p>From here a pleasant walk leads to the lovely palace of 
Charlottenburg.&nbsp; Coming from the large new palace it seemed too small 
for the dwelling even of the crown-prince.&nbsp; I should have taken it for
a splendid pavilion attached to the new palace, to which the royal family 
sometimes walked, and perhaps remained there to take refreshment.&nbsp; But
when I had inspected it more closely, and seen all the comfortable little 
rooms, furnished with such tasteful luxury, I felt that the crown-prince 
could not have made a better choice.</p>
<p>Beautiful fountains play on the terraces; the walls of the corridors and
anterooms are covered with splendid frescoes, in imitation of those found 
in Pompeii.&nbsp; The rooms abound in excellent engravings, paintings, and 
other works of art; and the greatest taste and splendour is displayed even 
in the minor arrangements.</p>
<p>A pretty Chinese chiosque, filled with good statues, which have been 
unfortunately much damaged and broken, stands near the palace.</p>
<p>These three beautiful royal residences are situated in parks, which are 
so united that they seem only as one.&nbsp; The parks are filled with fine 
trees, and verdant fields crossed by well-kept paths and drives; but I saw 
very few flower-beds in them.</p>
<p>When I had contemplated every thing at leisure, I returned to the palace
of Sans Souci, to see the beautiful fountains, which play twice a week, on 
Tuesday and Friday, from noon till evening.&nbsp; The columns projected 
from the basin in front of the castle are so voluminous, and rise with such
force, that I gazed in amazement at the artifice.&nbsp; It is real pleasure
to be near the basin when the sun shines in its full splendour, forming the
most beautiful rainbows in the falling shower of drops.&nbsp; Equally 
beautiful is a fountain rising from a high vase, enwreathed by living 
flowers, and falling over it, so that it forms a quick, brisk fountain, 
transparent, and pure as the finest crystal.&nbsp; The lid of the vase, 
also enwreathed with growing flowers, rises above the fountain.&nbsp; The 
Neptune&rsquo;s grotto is of no great beauty; the water falls from an urn 
placed over it, and forms little waterfalls as it flows over 
nautilus-shells.</p>
<p>The marble palace lies on the other side of Potsdam, and is half an 
hour&rsquo;s distance from these palaces; but I had time enough to visit 
it.</p>
<p>Entering the park belonging to this palace, a row of neat 
peasants&rsquo; cottages is seen on the left; they are all alike, but 
separated by fruit, flower, or kitchen-gardens.&nbsp; The palace lies at 
the extreme end of the park, on a pretty lake formed by the river 
Havel.&nbsp; It certainly has some right to the name of marble palace; but 
it seems presumption to call it so when compared to the marble palaces of 
Venice, or the marble mosques of Constantinople.</p>
<p>The walls of the building are of brick left in its natural colour.&nbsp;
The lower and upper frame-work, the window-sashes, and the portals, are all
of marble.&nbsp; The palace is partly surrounded by a gallery supported on 
marble columns.&nbsp; The stairs are of fine white marble, and many of the 
apartments are laid with this mineral.&nbsp; The interior is not nearly so 
luxurious as the other palaces.</p>
<p>This was the last of the sights I saw in Potsdam or the environs of 
Berlin; for I continued my journey to Vienna on the following day.</p>
<p>Before quitting Berlin, I must mention an arrangement which is 
particularly convenient for strangers&mdash;namely, the fares for 
hackney-carriages. One need ask no questions, but merely enter the 
carriage, tell the coachman where to drive, and pay him six-pence.&nbsp; 
This moderate fare is for the whole town, which is somewhat 
extensive.&nbsp; At all the railway stations there are numbers of these 
vehicles, which will drive to any hotel, however far it may be from the 
station, for the same moderate fare.&nbsp; If only all cab-drivers were so 
accommodating!</p>
<p style="text-align: right">October 1st.</p>
<p>The railway goes through Leipzic to Dresden, where I took the mail-coach
for Prague at eight o&rsquo;clock the same evening, and arrived there in 
eighteen hours.</p>
<p>As it was night when we passed, we did not enjoy the beautiful views of 
the Nollendorf mountain.&nbsp; In the morning we passed two handsome 
monuments, one of them, a pyramid fifty-four feet high, to the memory of 
Count Colloredo, the other to the memory of the Russian troops who had 
fallen here; both have been erected since the wars of Napoleon.</p>
<p>On we went through charming districts to the famed bathing-place 
Teplitz, which is surrounded by the most beautiful scenery; and can bear 
comparison with the finest bathing-places of the world.</p>
<p>Further on we passed a solitary basaltic rock, Boren, which deserves 
attention for its beauty and as a natural curiosity.&nbsp; We unfortunately
hurried past it, as we wished to reach Prague before six o&rsquo;clock, so 
that we might not miss the train to Vienna.</p>
<p>My readers may imagine our disappointment on arriving at the gates of 
Prague, when our passports were taken from us and not returned.&nbsp; In 
vain we referred to the <i>vis&eacute;</i> of the boundary-town 
Peterswalde; in vain we spoke of our haste.&nbsp; The answer always was, 
&ldquo;That is nothing to us; you can have your papers back to-morrow at 
the police-office.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus we were put off, and lost twenty-four 
hours.</p>
<p>I must mention a little joke I had on the ride from Dresden to 
Prague.&nbsp; Two gentlemen and a lady beside myself occupied the 
mail-coach; the lady happened to have read my diary of Palestine, and asked
me, when she heard my name, if I were that traveller.&nbsp; When I had 
acknowledged I was that same person, our conversation turned on that and on
my present journey.&nbsp; One of the gentlemen, Herr Katze, was very 
intelligent, and conversed in a most interesting manner on countries, 
nationalities, and scientific subjects.&nbsp; The other gentleman was 
probably equally well informed, but he made less use of his 
acquirements.&nbsp; Herr Katze remained in Teplitz, and the other gentleman
proceeded with us to Vienna.&nbsp; Before arriving at our destination, he 
asked me if Herr Katze had not requested me to mention his name in my next 
book, and added, that if I would promise to do the same, he would tell me 
his name.&nbsp; I could not refrain from smiling, but assured him that Herr
Katze had not thought of such a thing, and begged him not to communicate 
his name to me, so that he might see that we females were not so curious as
we are said to be.&nbsp; But the poor man could not refrain from giving me 
his name&mdash;Nicholas B.&mdash;before we parted.&nbsp; I do not insert it
for two reasons: first, because I did not promise to name him; and 
secondly, because I do not think it would do him any service.</p>
<p>The railway from Prague to Vienna goes over Olm&uuml;tz, and makes such 
a considerable round, that the distance is now nearly 320 miles, and the 
arrangements on the railway are very imperfect.</p>
<p>There were no hotels erected on the road, and we had to be content with 
fruit, beer, bread, and butter, &amp;c. the whole time.&nbsp; And these 
provisions were not easily obtained, as we could not venture to leave the 
carriages.&nbsp; The conductor called out at every station that we should 
go on directly, although the train frequently stood upwards of half an 
hour; but as we did not know that before, we were obliged to remain on our 
seats.&nbsp; The conductors were not of the most amiable character, which 
may perhaps be ascribed to the climate; for when we approached the boundary
of the Austrian states at Peterswalde, the inspector received us very 
gruffly.&nbsp; We wished him good evening twice, but he took no notice of 
it, and demanded our papers in a loud and peremptory tone; he probably 
thought us as deaf as we thought him.&nbsp; At G&auml;nserndorf, 
twenty-five miles from Vienna, they took our papers from us in a very 
uncivil, uncourteous manner.</p>
<p>On the 4th of October, 1845, after an absence of six months, I arrived 
again in sight of the dear Stephen&rsquo;s steeple, as most of my 
countrywomen would say.</p>
<p>I had suffered many hardships; but my love of travelling would not have 
been abated, nor would my courage have failed me, had they been ten times 
greater.&nbsp; I had been amply compensated for all.&nbsp; I had seen 
things which never occur in our common life, and had met with people as 
they are rarely met with&mdash;in their natural state.&nbsp; And I brought 
back with me the recollections of my travels, which will always remain, and
which will afford me renewed pleasure for years.</p>
<p>And now I take leave of my dear readers, requesting them to accept with 
indulgence my descriptions, which are always true, though they may not be 
amusing.&nbsp; If I have, as I can scarcely hope, afforded them some 
amusement, I trust they will in return grant me a small corner in their 
memories.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I beg to add an Appendix, which may not be uninteresting 
to many of my readers, namely:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; A document which I procured in Reikjavik, giving the salaries 
of the royal Danish officials, and the sources from whence they are 
paid.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; A list of Icelandic insects, butterflies, flowers, and plants, 
which I collected and brought home with me.</p>

about Frederick &ldquo;paying his score to the Austrians,&rdquo; is 
somewhat vague.&nbsp; The facts are these.&nbsp; In 1757 Frederick the 
Great of Prussia invaded Bohemia, and laid siege to Prague.&nbsp; Before 
this city an Austrian army lay, who were attacked with great impetuosity by
Frederick, and completely defeated.&nbsp; But the town was defended with 
great valour; and during the time thus gained the Austrian general Daun 
raised fresh troops, with which he took the field at Collin.&nbsp; Here he 
was attacked by Frederick, who was routed, and all his baggage and cannon 
captured.&nbsp; This loss was &ldquo;paying his score;&rdquo; and the 
defeat was so complete, that the great monarch sat down by the side of a 
fountain, and tracing figures in the sand, was lost for a long time in 
meditation on the means to be adopted to retrieve his fortune.</p>

<p><a name="footnote7"></a><a href="#citation7" 
class="footnote">[7]</a>&nbsp; The true version of this affair is as 
follows.&nbsp; John of Nepomuk was a priest serving under the Archbishop of
Prague.&nbsp; The king, Wenceslaus, was a hasty, cruel tyrant, who was 
detested by all his subjects, and hated by the rest of Germany.&nbsp; Two 
priests were guilty of some crime, and one of the court chamberlains, 
acting under royal orders, caused the priests to be put to death.&nbsp; The
archbishop, indignant at this, placed the chamberlain under an 
interdict.&nbsp; This so roused the king that he attempted to seize the 
archbishop, who took refuge in flight.&nbsp; John of Nepomuk, however, and 
another priest, were seized and put to the torture to confess what were the
designs of the archbishop.&nbsp; The king seems to have suspected that the 
queen was in some way connected with the line of conduct pursued by the 
archbishop.&nbsp; John of Nepomuk, however, refused, even though the King 
with his own hand burned him with a torch.&nbsp; Irritated by his obstinate
silence, the king caused the poor monk to be cast over the bridge into the 
Moldau.&nbsp; This monk was afterwards canonised, and made the patron saint
of bridges.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>
<p><a name="footnote8"></a><a href="#citation8" 
class="footnote">[8]</a>&nbsp; Albert von Wallenstein (or Waldstein), the 
famous Duke of Friedland, is celebrated as one of the ablest commanders of 
the imperial forces during the protracted religious contest known in German
history as the &ldquo;Thirty Years&rsquo; War.&rdquo;&nbsp; During its 
earlier period Wallenstein greatly distinguished himself, and was created 
by the Emperor Ferdinand Duke of Friedland and generalissimo of the 
imperial forces.&nbsp; In the course of a few months Wallenstein raised an 
army of forty thousand men in the Emperor&rsquo;s service.&nbsp; The 
strictest discipline was preserved <i>within</i> his camp, but his troops 
supported themselves by a system of rapine and plunder unprecedented even 
in those days of military license.&nbsp; Merit was rewarded with princely 
munificence, and the highest offices were within the reach of every common 
soldier who distinguished himself;&mdash;trivial breaches of discipline 
were punished with death.&nbsp; The dark and ambitious spirit of 
Wallenstein would not allow him to rest satisfied with the rewards and 
dignities heaped upon him by his imperial master.&nbsp; He temporised and 
entered into negotiations with the enemy; and during an interview with a 
Swedish general (Arnheim), is even said to have proposed an alliance to 
&ldquo;hunt the Emperor to the devil.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is supposed that he 
aspired to the sovereignty of Bohemia.&nbsp; Ferdinand was informed of the 
ambitious designs of his general, and at length determined that Wallenstein
should die.&nbsp; He despatched one of his generals, Gallas, to the 
commander-in-chief, with a mandate depriving him of his dignity of 
generalissimo, and nominating Gallas as his successor.&nbsp; Surprised 
before his plans were ripe, and deserted by many on whose support he had 
relied, Wallenstein retired hastily upon Egra.&nbsp; During a banquet in 
the castle, three of his generals who remained faithful to their leader 
were murdered in the dead of night.&nbsp; Roused by the noise, Wallenstein 
leapt from his bed, and encountered three soldiers who had been hired to 
despatch him.&nbsp; Speechless with astonishment and indignation, he 
stretched forth his arms, and receiving in his breast the stroke of a 
halbert, fell dead without a groan, in the fifty-first year of his age.</p>
<p>The following anecdote, curiously illustrative of the state of affairs 
in Wallenstein&rsquo;s camp, is related by Schiller in his <i>History of 
the Thirty Years&rsquo; War</i>, a work containing a full account of the 
life and actions of this extraordinary man.&nbsp; &ldquo;The extortions of 
Wallenstein&rsquo;s soldiers from the peasants had at one period reached 
such a pitch, that severe penalties were denounced against all marauders; 
and every soldier who should be convicted of theft was threatened with a 
halter.&nbsp; Shortly afterwards, it chanced that Wallenstein himself met a
soldier straying in the field, whom he caused to be seized, as having 
violated the law, and condemned to the gallows without a trial, by his 
usual word of doom: &ldquo;Let the rascal be hung!&rdquo;&nbsp; The soldier
protested, and proved his innocence.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then let them hang the 
innocent,&rdquo; cried the inhuman Wallenstein; &ldquo;and the guilty will 
tremble the more.&rdquo;&nbsp; The preparations for carrying this sentence 
into effect had already commenced, when the soldier, who saw himself lost 
without remedy, formed the desperate resolution that he would not die 
unrevenged.&nbsp; Rushing furiously upon his leader, he was seized and 
disarmed by the bystanders before he could carry his intention into 
effect.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now let him go,&rdquo; said Wallenstein; &ldquo;it 
will excite terror enough.&rdquo;&rdquo;&mdash;<span

legion in the armies of Napoleon, by whom he was highly respected.&nbsp; At
the battle of Leipzig, fought in October 1813, Poniatowski and Marshal 
MacDonald were appointed to command the rear of Napoleon&rsquo;s army, 
which, after two days hard fighting, was compelled to retreat before the 
Allies.&nbsp; These generals defended the retreat of the army so gallantly,
that all the French troops, except those under their immediate command, had
evacuated the town.&nbsp; The rear-guard was preparing to follow, when the 
only bridge over the Elster that remained open to them was destroyed, 
through some mistake.&nbsp; This effectually barred the escape of the rear 
of Napoleon&rsquo;s army.&nbsp; A few, among whom was Marshal MacDonald, 
succeeded in swimming across; but Poniatowski, after making a brave 
resistance, and refusing to surrender, was drowned in making the same 
attempt.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

book-mart of Germany.&nbsp; At the great Easter meetings, publishers from 
all the different states assemble at the &ldquo;Buchh&auml;ndler 
B&ouml;rse,&rdquo; and a large amount of business is done.&nbsp; The fairs 
of Leipzig have done much towards establishing the position of this city as
one of the first trading towns in Germany.&nbsp; They take place three 
times annually: at New-year, at Easter, and at Michaelmas; but the Easter 
fair is by far the most important.&nbsp; These commercial meetings last 
about three weeks, and during this time the town presents a most animated 
appearance, as the streets are thronged with the costumes of almost every 
nation, the smart dress of the Tyrolese contrasting gaily with the sombre 
garb of the Polish Jews.&nbsp; The amount of business transacted at these 
fairs is very considerable; on several occasions, above twenty thousand 
dealers have assembled.&nbsp; The trade is principally in woollen cloths; 
but lighter wares, and even ornaments of every description, are sold to a 
large extent.&nbsp; The manner in which every available place is taken 
advantage of is very curious: archways, cellars, passages, and courtyards 
are alike filled with merchandise, and the streets are at times so crowded 
as to be almost impassable.&nbsp; When the three weeks have passed, the 
wooden booths which have been erected in the market-place and the principal
streets are taken down, the buyers and sellers vanish together, and the 
visitor would scarcely recognise in the quiet streets around him the 
bustling busy city of a few days ago.&mdash;<span

raged with the utmost fury for three days.&nbsp; Whole streets were 
destroyed, and at least 2000 houses burned to the ground.&nbsp; Nearly half
a million of money was raised in foreign countries to assist in rebuilding 
the city, of which about a tenth was contributed by Britain.&nbsp; Such 
awful fires, fearful though they are at the time, seem absolutely necessary
to great towns, as they cause needful improvements to be made, which the 
indolence or selfishness of the inhabitants would otherwise prevent.&nbsp; 
There is not a great city that has not at one time or another suffered 
severely from fire, and has risen out of the ruins greater than 
before.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

consequently all the vessels lie in the river Elbe, and both receive and

in supposing that only London could show a picture of so many ships and so 
much commercial activity surpassing that of Hamburgh.&nbsp; Such a picture,
more impressive even than that seen in the Elbe, is exhibited every day in 
the Mersey or the Hudson.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

class="footnote">[15]</a>&nbsp; This great Danish sculptor was born of poor
parents at Copenhagen, on the 19th November, 1770; his father was an 
Icelander, and earned his living by carving figure-heads for ships.&nbsp; 
Albert, or &ldquo;Bertel,&rdquo; as he is more generally called, was 
accustomed during his youth to assist his father in his labours on the 
wharf.&nbsp; At an early age he visited the Academy at Copenhagen, where 
his genius soon began to make itself conspicuous.&nbsp; At the age of 
sixteen he had won a silver, and at twenty a gold medal.&nbsp; Two years 
later he carried off the &ldquo;great&rdquo; gold medal, and was sent to 
study abroad at the expense of the Academy.&nbsp; In 1797 we find him 
practising his art at Rome under the eye of Zoega the Dane, who does not, 
however, seem to have discovered indications of extraordinary genius in the
labours of his young countryman.&nbsp; But a work was soon to appear which 
should set all questions as to Thorwaldsen&rsquo;s talent for ever at 
rest.&nbsp; In 1801 he produced his celebrated statue of 
&ldquo;Jason,&rdquo; which was at once pronounced by the great Canova to be
&ldquo;a work in a new and a grand style.&rdquo;&nbsp; After this period 
the path of fame lay open before the young sculptor; his bas-reliefs of 
&ldquo;Summer&rdquo; and &ldquo;Autumn,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Dance of the 
Muses,&rdquo; &ldquo;Cupid and Psyche,&rdquo; and numerous other works, 
followed each other in rapid succession; and at length, in 1812, 
Thorwaldsen produced his extraordinary work, &ldquo;The Triumph of 
Alexander.&rdquo;&nbsp; In 1819 Thorwaldsen returned rich and famous to the
city he had quitted as a youth twenty-three years before; he was received 
with great honour, and many feasts and rejoicings were held to celebrate 
his arrival.&nbsp; After a sojourn of a year Thorwaldsen again visited 
Rome, where he continued his labours until 1838, when, wealthy and 
independent, he resolved to rest in his native country.&nbsp; This time his
welcome to Copenhagen was even more enthusiastic than in 1819.&nbsp; The 
whole shore was lined with spectators, and amid thundering acclamations the
horses were unharnessed from his carriage, and the sculptor was drawn in 
triumph by the people to his <i>atelier</i>.&nbsp; During the remainder of 
his life Thorwaldsen passed much of his time on the island of Nys&ouml;, 
where most of his latest works were executed.&nbsp; On Sunday, March 9th, 
1842, he had been conversing with a circle of friends in perfect 
health.&nbsp; Halm&rsquo;s tragedy of <i>Griselda</i> was announced for the
evening, and Thorwaldsen proceeded to the theatre to witness the 
performance.&nbsp; During the overture he rose to allow a stranger to pass,
then resumed his seat, and a moment afterwards his head sunk on his 
breast&mdash;he was dead!</p>
<p>His funeral was most sumptuous.&nbsp; Rich and poor united to do honour 
to the memory of the great man, who had endeared himself to them by his 
virtues as by his genius.&nbsp; The crown-prince followed the coffin, and 
the people of Copenhagen stood in two long rows, and uncovered their heads 
as the coffin of the sculptor was carried past.&nbsp; The king himself took
part in the solemnity.&nbsp; At the time of his decease Thorwaldsen had 
completed his seventy-second year.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

him under the notice of the King of Denmark, with whose assistance he

ancient chair&rdquo; referred to in the text, and surrounded by numerous 
assistants, he directed for seventeen years a series of observations, that 
have been found extremely accurate and useful.&nbsp; On the death of his 
patron he retired to Prague in Bohemia, where he was employed by Rodolph 
II. then Emperor of Germany.&nbsp; Here he was assisted by the great 
Kepler, who, on Tycho&rsquo;s death in 1601, succeeded him.&mdash;<span

ways.&nbsp; Since the discovery of Newfoundland, however, the fisheries of 
Iceland have lost much of their importance.&nbsp; So early as 1415, the 
English sent fishing vessels to the Icelandic coast, and the sailors who 
were on board, it would appear, behaved so badly to the natives that Henry 
V. had to make some compensation to the King of Denmark for their 
conduct.&nbsp; The greatest number of fishing vessels from England that 
ever visited Iceland was during the reign of James I., whose marriage with 
the sister of the Danish king might probably make England at the time the 
most favoured nation.&nbsp; It was in his time that an English pirate, 
&ldquo;Gentleman John,&rdquo; as he was called, committed great ravages in 
Iceland, for which James had afterwards to make compensation.&nbsp; The 
chief markets for the fish are in the Catholic countries of Europe.&nbsp; 
In the seventeenth century, a great traffic in fish was carried on between 
Iceland and Spain.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span></p>

of attending a ball in Iceland, the following description of one given by 
Sir George Mackenzie may be interesting to the reader.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We gave a ball to the ladies of Reikjavik and the 
neighbourhood.&nbsp; The company began to assemble about nine 
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; We were shewn into a small low-roofed room, in which 
were a number of men, but to my surprise I saw no females.&nbsp; We soon 
found them, however, in one adjoining, where it is the custom for them to 
wait till their partners go to hand them out.&nbsp; On entering this 
apartment, I felt considerable disappointment at not observing a single 
woman dressed in the Icelandic costume.&nbsp; The dresses had some 
resemblance to those of English chambermaids, but were not so smart.&nbsp; 
An old lady, the wife of the man who kept the tavern, was habited like the 
pictures of our great-grandmothers.&nbsp; Some time after the dancing 
commenced, the bishop&rsquo;s lady, and two others, appeared in the proper 
dress of the country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We found ourselves extremely awkward in dancing what the ladies 
were pleased to call English country dances.&nbsp; The music, which came 
from a solitary ill-scraped fiddle, accompanied by the rumbling of the same
half-rotten drum that had summoned the high court of justice, and by the 
jingling of a rusty triangle, was to me utterly unintelligible.&nbsp; The 
extreme rapidity with which it was necessary to go through many complicated
evolutions in proper time, completely bewildered us; and our mistakes, and 
frequent collisions with our neighbours, afforded much amusement to our 
fair partners, who found it for a long time impracticable to keep us in the
right track.&nbsp; When allowed to breathe a little, we had an opportunity 
of remarking some singularities in the state of society and manners among 
the Danes of Reikjavik.&nbsp; While unengaged in the dance, the men drink 
punch, and walk about with tobacco-pipes in their mouths, spitting 
plentifully on the floor.&nbsp; The unrestrained evacuation of saliva seems
to be a fashion all over Iceland; but whether the natives learned it from 
the Danes, or the Danes from the natives, we did not ascertain.&nbsp; 
Several ladies whose virtue could not bear a very strict scrutiny were 
pointed out to us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;During the dances, tea and coffee were handed about; and negus 
and punch were ready for those who chose to partake of them.&nbsp; A cold 
supper was provided, consisting of hams, beef, cheese, &amp;c., and 
wine.&nbsp; While at table, several of the ladies sang, and acquitted 
themselves tolerably well.&nbsp; But I could not enjoy the performance, on 
account of the incessant talking, which was as fashionable a rudeness in 
Iceland as it is now in Britain.&nbsp; This, however, was not considered as
in the least unpolite.&nbsp; One of the songs was in praise of the donors 
of the entertainment; and, during the chorus, the ceremony of touching each
other&rsquo;s glasses was performed.&nbsp; After supper, waltzes were 
danced, in a style that reminded me of soldiers marching in cadence to the 
dead march in Saul.&nbsp; Though there was no need of artificial light, a 
number of candles were placed in the rooms.&nbsp; When the company broke 
up, about three o&rsquo;clock, the sun was high above the 
horizon.&rdquo;</p>

are consumed to a vast extent by the natives.&nbsp; The desire seems to be

undoubtedly render them more susceptible to the cold of these inclement

these hyperborean races for a kind of food from which we would turn in

lighted by oil-lamps, several Russian noblemen visited that metropolis; and

evening so intense, that, unable to procure the delicacy in any other way, 
they emptied the oil-lamps.&nbsp; Parry relates that when he was wintering

class="footnote">[33]</a>&nbsp; An American travelling in Iceland in 1852 
thus describes, in a letter to the <i>Boston Post</i>, the mode of 
travelling:&mdash;&ldquo;All travel is on horseback.&nbsp; Immense numbers 
of horses are raised in the country, and they are exceedingly cheap.&nbsp; 
As for travelling on foot, even short journeys, no one ever thinks of 
it.&nbsp; The roads are so bad for walking, and generally so good for 
riding that shoe-leather, to say nothing of fatigue, would cost nearly as 
much as horse-flesh.&nbsp; Their horses are small, compact, hardy little 
animals, a size larger than Shetland ponies, but rarely exceeding from 12 
or 13&frac12; hands high.&nbsp; A stranger in travelling must always have a
&lsquo;guide,&rsquo; and if he does go equipped for a good journey and 
intends to make good speed, he wants as many as six horses; one for 
himself, one for the guide, one for the luggage, and three relay 
horses.&nbsp; Then when one set of horses are tired the saddles are 
exchanged to the others.&nbsp; The relay horses are tied together and are 
either led or driven before the others.&nbsp; A tent is often carried, 
unless a traveller chooses to chance it for his lodgings.&nbsp; Such an 
article as an hotel is not kept in Iceland out of the capital.&nbsp; You 
must also carry your provisions with you, as you will be able to get but 
little on your route.&nbsp; Plenty of milk can be had, and some fresh-water
fish.&nbsp; The luggage is carried in trunks that are hung on each side of 
the horse, on a rude frame that serves as a pack-saddle.&nbsp; Under this, 
broad pieces of turf are placed to prevent galling the horse&rsquo;s 
back.&rdquo;</p>

shillings per pound, so that the produce of each nest is about three

returning from market, that it would be easier for him to throw away the

that owing to his treachery the free island of Iceland came beneath the 
Norwegian sceptre.&nbsp; For this reason he could never appear in Iceland 
without a strong guard, and therefore visited the Allthing under the 
protection of a small army of 600 men.&nbsp; Being at length surprised by 
his enemies in his house at Reikiadal, he fell beneath their blows, after a
short and ineffectual resistance.&nbsp; [Snorri Sturluson, the most 
distinguished name of which Iceland can boast, was born, in 1178, at 
Hoam.&nbsp; In his early years he was remarkably fortunate in his worldly 
affairs.&nbsp; The fortune he derived from his father was small, but by 
means of a rich marriage, and by inheritance, he soon became proprietor of 
large estates in Iceland.&nbsp; Some writers say that his guard of 600 men,
during his visit to the Allthing, was intended not as a defence, as 
indicated in Madame Pfeiffer&rsquo;s note, but for the purposes of display,
and to impress the inhabitants with forcible ideas of his influence and 
power.&nbsp; He was invited to the court of the Norwegian king, and there 
he either promised or was bribed to bring Iceland under the Norwegian 
power.&nbsp; For this he has been greatly blamed, and stigmatised as a 
traitor; though it would appear from some historians that he only undertook
to do by peaceable means what otherwise the Norwegian kings would have 
effected by force, and thus saved his country from a foreign 
invasion.&nbsp; But be this as it may, it is quite clear that he sunk in 
the estimation of his countrymen, and the feeling against him became so 
strong, that he was obliged to fly to Norway.&nbsp; He returned, however, 
in 1239, and in two years afterwards he was assassinated by his own 
son-in-law.&nbsp; The work by which he is chiefly known is the 
<i>Heimskringla</i>, or Chronicle of the Sea-Kings of Norway, one of the 
most valuable pieces of northern history, which has been admirably 
translated into English by Mr. Samuel Laing.&nbsp; This curious name of

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://www.gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or

terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
